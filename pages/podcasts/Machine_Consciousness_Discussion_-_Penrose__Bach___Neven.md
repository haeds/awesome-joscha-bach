Thank you very much, right? Well, we're at a tiny, tiny bit behind time. But that's only because we started 10 minutes later, I'm obviously in desperate trouble with Roger, for allowing it to go late. But I was trying to explain that this is San Diego. And we're very relaxed. And so I hope that's okay. So if we get our speakers up on stage, we want to sit up on stage. And we'll just answer a few questions that are burning to you. We have a couple of roving mics, do we? And when I take a couple of questions, while we're assembling people, I'll try and remember them and then I'll be able to speak them back, and so on. So the gentleman in the black, why don't you ask the question me? And then I will deal with it in once we've got all our speakers here. Yes, right. Okay. Got that one. Now the one on the line.

Unknown 1:01
With Nevins presentation. I've thought about this a long time myself the difference between pleasure and pain that occurs to me, and I'd like you to comment. That is somewhat like distance. In other words, pain. And pleasure is more like constants. It's like,

Unknown 1:20
musical analogy, a musical analogy. Okay. And one more question. I'll stack up, and then I'll stop giving them out. To musical analogy, gentlemen, yeah, yeah.

Unknown 1:32
Yeah, this is question for Dr. Penrose. Do you think that the laws of the universe is the consciousness or awareness of the universe? Taking the fact that every space and time moment of time in universe is aware of these laws

Unknown 1:50
itself? No. I mean, the universe as a whole? Not in my opinion. I mean, you could imagine such a thing. In my opinion, consciousness comes about when the proto consciousness is organized, orchestrated, in a way in relation to the first question, which I don't have any clear idea about, I'm afraid. So I don't think the universe as a whole is conscious, it would need to

Unknown 2:19
repeat the question. Sorry.

Unknown 2:28
Oh, I see the questions change.

Unknown 2:30
My question is that the since the universe is aware of the laws, every moment of time and space, knows the laws of conservation need are to be true. Does that mean it's awareness? Let's forget the consciousness? Is the universe aware of its laws constitute the awareness of the universe?

Unknown 2:53
Not in my terminology, I mean, the universe? Isn't universe as a whole is not in my view, aware of anything? It's not. That's aware. It's just an aspect of consciousness in my view. I mean, it's not the whole of consciousness, but it's some aspect of it. So no, I mean, we'd have to the view is that you have to have this reduction, spontaneous reduction. And the spontaneous reduction is just an element, protocol. joyousness. It's not the universe as a whole, it happens in certain places. So I can't see that the answer to the question is yes, in my view.

Unknown 3:37
So the second question was about basically, to what extent is pleasure and pain, similar to music or some sort of thing like that? So why don't I get that to Harvard? And then you can.

Unknown 3:53
I felt I went already out on a limb, proposing that relaxing to a stable state is feels pleasant and going to an excited state as unpleasant that just struck me that this fits together with a number of observations or logical constraints. sort of pushing it beyond says it will be another maybe somebody comes up with sort of a measurement protocol, how we could assess when obviously, cannot be such a subtle phenomenon in the human nervous system. And of course, all sorts of studies what happens when you eat a cookie? But sort of breaking it down to at what what are the systems that really correlate with a pleasant sensation, that meal so far from that?

Joscha Bach 4:46
I think pleasure is a learning signal is created whenever you feel feel a need, and it's proportional to the amount of need fulfillment that you do per unit of time. With respect to music, the pleasure It's generated from music has many possible dimensions. One of them is aesthetic, you have a certain structure discovery that possibly piggybacks on some of the functionality that we have for learning language, then there are physiological parameters that might be elicited by music that you can train your physiological reasons and your brain patterns versus the music, which itself can be intrinsically pleasant, then there are social connotations that go with music negative connotation and so forth, they can fulfill many, many different needs. And this means that music can be intrinsically pleasant if you are susceptible to one of those needs.

Unknown 5:39
This this question is regarding neural networks. So, we have been talking about deep neural networks. So, as we understand that it is a basic computing unit, and we also talked in morning about microtubules. So, can microtubules be considered as basic computing unit? Which can act have? Which, which can, you know, the quantum effect can be implemented using it? And the third part is that when we talk about the concepts, biologically, these are electrical spikes, how do concept translate to these electrical spikes?

Unknown 6:17
So, I think the question is, is a neuron A computing unit? And how does a neuron represent concepts? Yes, gosh, is there anyone up here? Who'd like to answer that question? We don't have any neurologists up here, remember, who would like to your current con, you can do that one.

Joscha Bach 6:36
I don't think that concepts are represented by individual neurons, they are represented by ensembles of neurons. And I suspect and it's not saying that is completely consensus yet, because there are a multitude of theories on how that works. That concepts form a map. That is something like the address space of your sensorimotor scripts of the things that produce your mental representations and concepts are synchronized between speakers to language, which is why we can use statistical analysis of language to do machine translation. These machine translations work only on conceptual structures, nothing below this, they cannot imagine what the concept means. The concept is basically what anchors different linguistic symbols that are synonyms on some part of a landscape. And these landscapes is a map that is produced and held stable by a multitude of different neurons that are working together and forming circuits and oscillators. Does this answer your question?

Unknown 7:37
Excellent. middle, middle back there.

Unknown 7:40
I have another question for you. So in your model, what do you think the difference between consciousness and self consciousness or let's say, self awareness? In your model, what is the

Unknown 7:54
difference between awareness? And who you asking the question to? The I don't remember about the middle? Yasha? Right. Okay. So self awareness, the self, same as awareness of other things? Yeah,

Unknown 8:07
let's say we have the awareness or consciousness about pain. And you know, the awareness that you are the one that has this pain, no, okay.

Joscha Bach 8:19
I think when you meditate, you can discover that your awareness of yourself can be redirected on the awareness of something else. So for instance, you might identify as a prospective being this the universe itself, if you lose the connection, or dissociated to yourself concept. This means to identify, for instance, as a human being, or as a social person, or somebody who wants something, and so on is somewhat arbitrary. It's a trick that the mind uses to make a particular kind of model and regulate that model. And you can change that model into becoming aware of that You are the universe and you have the illusion that there is a cosmic consciousness because suddenly your representation of the universe gets unified with what you think is your perspective at on it. But this is a mental state. There is a difference between this perspective self and the awareness of having a consciousness of having conscious access and the advance of consciousness doesn't need to have content. It's the awareness of the fact that there are a model of the fact that there is a process that accesses your own models.

Unknown 9:29
Yeah, question Was it is self awareness, the same as awareness of the world? Do they have that right? I mean, the same kind of thing I would say, but self aware, I mean, I'm just going to make a stupid obvious comment. Self awareness is awareness of oneself and awareness of the world is awareness of the world that just different. The awareness is the same, but the different things it's aware of.

Unknown 9:53
Give that to you. For next question. We have one for Hartmut Hamid, okay. I was confused by your observation three,

Unknown 10:08
where where you said that it would be worthwhile to replace the the top layers of a neural network with with a quantum computer, I would have expected the exact opposite. For example, we when we do transfer learning, we remove the top layers of of a neural network and replace it with an SVM, for example. Okay, so why is it buys my intuition wrong? Why wouldn't it be that you would want the quantum computer to discover better features, for example,

Unknown 10:33
for example, if you were to find, so what we have done, we have done like little numerical tests for simulated quantum neural networks. And then we found for examples that we could learn something like subset parity to a much larger number of inputs, then a classical neural net, essentially, a classical neural net would have to be larger to do the same thing and would have more parameters, and therefore it takes longer time to learn. So if you were to find, let's say, a mapping from 50 input units to just one output unit, for certain types of learning tasks works much better on a quantum neural network. For better meaning, for example, lower sample complexity, you need less training samples, then you can easily use this in a much bigger concept. Sorry, context, by letting the lower level tasks such as feature extraction be done by the early layers of your neural network. I'm not saying this is the only way to do it. But this would be a very straightforward way. Let's say often deep neural networks, even though they might have 1000s of output units, they are often if you use something like logistic regression, essentially, each output neuron fights for its itself and sort of these funnels that end in single neurons on the output layer. So it's just a very straightforward way to use a quantum neural network here. And now as soon as we discover even on a 50 input, Quentin, your net, some advantages.

Unknown 12:06
Okay, so your observation was basically about efficiency and speed rather than better features. Right? That that particular observation?

Unknown 12:15
In the moment I'm, I'm just after efficiency and speed. Yeah.

Unknown 12:19
Okay, thank you. Another question for Roger, maybe? Just, okay, gentleman on the blue one in from the green, and then maybe you can negotiate between you as to whether you're, you've got the same question or a different question.

Unknown 12:35
My question was for Roger, Roger, I don't understand what your post collapse wave function looks like. If you look at the spontaneous collapse theories developed by Philip perot in Germany, remedia and Weber, and so forth. If you have a particle, which initially starts out, it's confined to one dimension of space, and it initially starts out in a superposition of two Gaussians, where those Gaussians are located in separate places along the dimension of space, then the post collapse wave function is still a superposition of two Gaussians. One is just raised and the other is lowered. And there are technical reasons for why they have to settle for this. But what it means is that the post collapse wave function is still always a superposition in the literature, that's called the tails problem. So I'm wondering what the post collapse wave function looks like on your theory, because it looks to me that if your post collapse wave functions also have tails, then you can never remove superpositions of spacetime curvature.

Unknown 13:37
Don't think I understood the question? I mean, you have these ideas of yake, a heroine of involve looking at pre selection and post selection. And you can get cases where you have rather extraordinary things happening where they very rarely occur, but they seem to be rather strange. I'm not sure if that's what you're talking about. And I didn't quite see. I didn't understand the point at the end.

Unknown 14:03
Okay, so I and I know you and I know your physics is fairly thorough. So we probably that's a discussion over a cup of coffee. Thank you very much for that one. Gentleman, the green in the middle. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Yeah, we've got a man with

Unknown 14:18
this is a question partly for Roger and partly for everyone else. And I'll set it in context. The question is very simple. Why do you assume that there is only classical physics and quantum physics, and everything you have to do with computation, computation, realism, or any other computer calculations you're using is only going to be looking at quantum theory and quantum models. That's the question. Now I set it in context. In the human physiology, everything happens from criticality, everything in human regulation, which ultimately means the human mind It happens from complexity. And complexity means instability. And the physics of instability, which is critical instabilities has nothing to do with either classical physics or quantum physics. So why do you limit yourselves to quantum physics?

Unknown 15:20
Well, I'm going to answer a little bit of that question a question. Okay. So so so I think that, what you're saying is that people on the panel, including me, are only talking about classical or quantum physics. And I think that that's wrong. I think what Roger is saying is that classical and quantum physics are insufficient, right? That something appears to be going on in our heads, that would require a modification to quantum physics, as we know, at the moment, which is not quantum physics, as we know at the moment, so we're trying to add an additional feature.

Unknown 15:55
Yeah, I sort of agree that, yes, I mean, the view I have is that classical physics and quantum physics are both approximations to something that we don't know yet. We get some idea of what it's like. But we need to have a better theory than either one or the other. It's true that in many circumstances, you can treat it according to quantum physics, or according to classical physics, because the other part doesn't play much of a role. But yes, there's something more, as James was just saying, and the something more would have as limiting cases, current, our current view of quantum mechanics or our current view of classical general relativity, and so one has a more inclusive theory. It's not that you have one or the other, you have the bigger theory, which may specialize in some circumstances to look like quantum physics or in other circumstances to look like classical physics.

Unknown 16:55
I think the I think the other two of you interesting to see what the what what

Joscha Bach 17:00
I think it's a very interesting division between us. It's completely correct to say that you are trying to go beyond current physics, you will try to make an extension to physics, which is very bold, because we don't have data. In this particular area. It's more conceptual, we don't know what that is going to be yet. Physics at the moment assumes that the world is made from quantum fields that evolve to some kind of Hamiltonian, or another mathematical formalism that comes down to something that is mathematically equivalent, but written down in a different way. And it could be that we change that, but we don't know about this. And for us, the question is, what kind of computation is facilitated in this universe? Or outside of this universe? And what kind of computation? Do we need to build the equivalent of mines? Roger thinks we need computation that goes beyond the computation that is known in physics. I think the classical computation is probably sufficient. You think that classical computation is probably sufficient, but it's going to be much faster with quantum computation, right?

Unknown 18:01
Why don't you hand the microphone for Hamid? And he can answer that question.

Unknown 18:05
So maybe first, I want to make a bit of an upbeat observation, in the sense that what we observe is that quantum information has given fields of physics had previously we're not talking to each other much a common language. So suddenly, people who wonder about information paradox of black holes, and wonder what happens if you throw a qubit into a black hole, which is entangled with another qubits that's outside of the event horizon, or condensed matter physicists or quantum biology, folks, they can all look at each other's equations now and understand to some degree what the other is doing. So I think that bodes very well for the next 10 years seeing interesting fusions of areas of physics. But of course, the fundamental part of your question is more Nyan. Maybe a bad excuse, but we just take baby steps quantum physics is what I have now what I somewhat understand and we can build machines based on this theory, I'm not by any means saying this is the end of it. And of course, history of science would suggest that in probably 50 years we will talk about maybe David Deutsch his new constructor theory completely other forms of physical theory I don't know but it's likely

Unknown 19:28
gentleman in the hat is off to a burning question final comment?

Unknown 19:31
Hello, stability Physics I Scott lately non computational.

Unknown 19:38
Thank you. Gentlemen, the hat.

Unknown 19:40
I I know that most of us here and most of the discussion around artificial intelligence seeing as we are human beings, the model that we have in mind, the holy grail is to replicate the human mind. But seeing as there are so many different forms of intelligence on this planet, is there a benefit to the development of artificial intelligence, looking at non human forms of animal problem solving and other forms of intelligence.

Unknown 20:15
So this will be squirrels and crows and dolphins and

Unknown 20:19
dads and bees into the car, there are situations where non human forms of intelligence may be able to complete tasks better than a human based AI, you wrote the microphone.

Joscha Bach 20:33
The main form of artificial intelligence will not be robots that are existing on the same level of us, the main form of AI will be organizations, it will be corporations, nation states, universities, whatever built needs compute, to make sense of what it's doing. And we will be living inside of AI largely not next to it, it's not going to be robots that compete with us for resources, it's going to be stuff where we are going to be mostly the microbiome. Of course, there's also going to be intelligent artifacts, but it makes probably more sense to imagine robots as the extremities of future AI. In this sense, we don't we should not expect AI to be very similar to human AI, personally am interested in building humanoid AI, because I want to understand how we work, and also interested for the same reason in animal like AI, because I'm interested in how minds work in general. But in practice, if we are able to build to build sentient machines, they are going to be organizational things mostly.

Unknown 21:31
And Roger, we've we've asked, we've talked about whether squirrels or dogs were conscious or intelligent, you know?

Unknown 21:38
Yes, well, I think the way I look at this question is that the reason that AI seems to be trying to compete is perhaps the wrong word with human intelligence is because that's what it's trying to do. I mean, it's trying to play chess or go or whatever it happens to be, or, or do things that human beings do. And maybe sometimes try to do them better than humans do it. And we're not so interested in trying to do machines that do things better than squirrels. But I don't see why you shouldn't study that. It's just wouldn't you wouldn't get so much money, I suppose for studying AI for squirrels. But it seems to me it's just this is the way it's driving. And that's why AI is aimed, I don't think it's a total lack of humans the way we think or what we do. I think what we think and what we just literally like what squirrels do, what AI does, but isn't perhaps the question,

Unknown 22:34
and heartless, when your quantum AI machines or your quantum computing machines grow up? And they become very powerful? Will they look anything like a human being or a squirrel or a dog or, or nothing like them?

Unknown 22:47
The first question, actually, when I wrote my PhD on autonomous mobile robots, the strategies we use to have some navigate through our institute and find back, let's say there's a power station that was very much modeled after her. And so let's navigate or simpler systems, or sorry, simpler animals that was very fashionable at the time. And I'm still a big fan of looking sort of at. I think, for example, the intelligence of the single cell is way under appreciated. I think, if you look, evolutionary periods, I think a single cell is probably the most optimized machinery. And I would like us to think more what amazing feats or what it would take to replicate amazing feats of a single cell. I'm big fan of this, in terms of quantum I made my talks as the case that I'm convinced that the most, I think creativity can be well described by or formalized by finding a low point and an objective landscape that expresses an optimization landscape. And quantum enhanced optimization will be better in finding those low lying minima, and hence, will be the most creative system we know to build to date. So there's no doubt about that.

Joscha Bach 24:17
One important point is maybe think about the difference between a dog and a human what is the difference between a dog mind and the human mind, one of the obvious differences is given by the affordances of the dog, the dog doesn't have hands. It smells as much better smell than humans. And this means that the world presents itself very different to a dog. The next thing is dog has different needs, the social needs and the cognitive needs of a dog have a very different as a result, it's going to pay attention to very different things. And it means it learns very different things. Because you only learn things that give you reward signals, and you only pay attention to those things that capture your attention because you have a need that is related to them. And then the largest and maybe most important difference is that our development is much much slower. Her brain is slightly larger than the one of a dog, which means during our adolescence during the training phase of our brain Viva see vastly more training data than the dog's brain. So we get to much better abstraction than a dog can possibly can get to.

Unknown 25:13
So So do you have one more last thing to say on that point? But I think we're at time. So is there one more burning question out there that someone feels a must be asked? Or answered today? Or really, but the gentleman right at the back there? That hasn't spoken so far?

Unknown 25:36
I have a question for a Yash. And I'm wondering if he feels a current modern digital computer could ever become conscious running a software program?

Unknown 25:46
Oh, well, that's that's the end? That's the topic, isn't it? And

Unknown 25:48
if not what what hardware would be required to make a computer conscious?

Unknown 25:55
What hardware would we need? Well, to make a computer conscious, so Roger Penrose would say,

Unknown 26:02
well, you need to take advantage of the quantum state reduction. I mean, this is a it's not a question of using artefill artificial intelligence in the way we use it. Now you need to have some, something which harnessed in relation to everything it was the first or the second question, which I didn't have a clear answer to, namely, you would have to, on my view, have a way of taking advantage of what's going on in quantum state reduction. See, at the moment, it's very hard even to see the effect at all and an experiment. So we're way way off it. But without doing that, in my view, we don't have consciousness at all. So in my view, none of the devices, artificially intelligent devices, computer driven devices, have any consciousness at all, unlike us, something is going on in our brains, which involves on the viewer hold the reduction of the quantum state, and that being correlated orchestrated over large areas of the brain. And that would in on this view, in that consciousness, but we're so far off doing that, at the moment, we don't even know from a physical experiments that this process that I'm talking about actually exists, we know that something must happen in reduction of the quantum state. But we don't know exactly what

Unknown 27:28
you're sure do you think a computer could just do it? You only got like a one sentence answer.

Joscha Bach 27:34
A year ago, I taught a class at MIT about the future of AI. And it took a small survey in that class on what kind of hardware do we need to build a mind that is capable of human performance and consciousness and so on. I think most of us felt that consciousness is going to be naturally emerging as soon as the system starts to model its own attention properly. And the capacity for doing that the majority of the class was quite optimistic, we thought we can probably run a person on 200 gigabytes if you only knew how. You don't know how we're pretty optimistic with respect to this. But we have some reason to believe that these numbers might already be sufficient. We had a couple students that thought we need petabytes, and we had one student that we thought we need exabytes. But ever the outers

Unknown 28:18
brought up a quantum gravity computer, you're sure. A big enough computer? Are you undecided at the moment?

Unknown 28:26
No, but you're asking the wrong person. Personally, my view on this is most pan psychist view is that essentially I think consciousness is associated with elementals of physics, and we should most think about it like mass or spin or possibly state reduction, as Roger suggests, in that sense. Consciousness pervasive, it's totally in the grain of salt, sand, I would say there is some proto conscious present.

Unknown 28:56
Sort of the wrong question. You don't know machine would do it the universe sort

Unknown 29:00
of cannabis makes like objection to the term quantum gravity computer. Yes, of course. Because first of all, it's not quantum gravity, because the term quantum gravity means the correct application of I mean, the the application of what we regard as current quantum mechanics to gravitation theory, whereas this is almost the opposite. Its gravitational quantum mechanics.

Unknown 29:23
I shouldn't I shouldn't I shouldn't sorry, baited you in that way. There shouldn't be a term for it. Yeah, we need a good term for a relativistic quantum computer or a quantum, a modified quantum computer. Thank you, everybody. That's the end.
