Welcome to deconstructing yourself, the podcast for modern mutants interested in mindfulness meditation, awakening, general artificial intelligence, Steven Universe, emptiness, and more. My name is Michael Taft, your host on the podcast. And in this episode, I'm happy to be speaking with Yoshi, Bach. Dr. Yoshida, Bach is an artificial intelligence researcher at MIT and Harvard, who works and writes about cognitive architectures, mental representation, emotion, social modeling, and multi agent systems. Box mission to build a model of the mind is the bedrock research in the creation of Strong Artificial Intelligence, which means cognition on par with that of a human being. He is especially interested in the philosophy of artificial intelligence. And in the augmentation of the human mind. I met your Shabbat got a Bay Area event several years ago. And I was intrigued by his core interest, which is to try to understand our minds by building artificial minds. And I love the way that he's flipped the normal motivation in artificial intelligence research. Most people are trying to use human minds as a model for their machines. But Yoshida is trying to build machines that act like human minds so that we can understand human minds better. It's very fascinating. And so let's jump right in with the episode that I call what can artificial intelligence tell us about the human mind with the OSHA buck? You're so welcome to deconstructing yourself.

Joscha Bach 2:00
Thank you for having me.

Unknown 2:01
So just for the edification of listeners, and to kind of orient us what do you do in the world?

Joscha Bach 2:09
I mostly use artificial intelligence ideas to understand how we work, how this is happening to us, what's our relationship to the world? And what kind of system RV

Unknown 2:20
so this is kind of an interesting inversion, what I hear you saying is that you're studying artificial intelligence to kind of model human beings.

Joscha Bach 2:31
Yeah, or something more general, I think human beings are a specific solution to the question of what it's like to be a mind. And I'm interested in the class of systems that are capable of making sense of their

Unknown 2:44
environment. You've been doing this at universities, correct? Yeah.

Joscha Bach 2:48
Mostly, I was at MIT for a while now at Harvard, and not see how this will take me?

Unknown 2:54
And are you currently actively like building an AI? Or is your work about something different than that?

Joscha Bach 3:01
I'm looking on small topics. In this context, I'm mostly interested right now in understanding motivation, and emotion. I'm also interested in how perception generally scales up into more general modeling, and what the relationship between attention and perception and reasoning is. But these are lots of small topics. And I'm not sure when I'll be ready to put this all together into a single system that has it all.

Unknown 3:25
How did you get involved in this very interesting topic, obviously,

Joscha Bach 3:28
I suspect that by now I sat in front of my Commodore 64. Sometime in 1983, I looked on its screen and realize that everything that I can come up with, I can put in there to make it manifest on the screen. And this screen isn't a lot like my interface to the universe. What I see I see on the screen, I make sense of it and my own mind, and the universe is some kind of pattern generator, and the computer is a tool. And that allows me to generate arbitrary patterns. So if I'm able to capture structural relationships, in some kind of universe, I can reproduce them in a computer and put that thing into the computer effectively, from a functional perspective.

Unknown 4:06
You can model the external universe inside the computer, yes.

Joscha Bach 4:10
Okay. I can model anything I want not just the external universe right. Now, that's an interesting question, if the external universe already is everything that could possibly exist, but we don't know that

Unknown 4:20
we can imagine a lot of stuff that doesn't exist.

Joscha Bach 4:23
Yeah, of course, but most of the stuff eventually would need to come from somewhere, right? So there needs to be a cohesive structure that would make it possible to derive these things from first principles. And there are some things which just didn't happen like unicorns,

Unknown 4:38
come on, unicorns are real.

Joscha Bach 4:42
And then there are some things which in principle cannot happen, like the set of all sets that don't contain themselves, because it leads to internal contradictions. And there are many things that would lead to contradictions with the transition function of the universe.

Unknown 4:54
What does that mean the transition function of the universe,

Joscha Bach 4:57
or the universe seems to move from the past. vectors have an observer, right? So we exist in a frame of description in which things are changing. And information is always related to change. And the meaning of information information is what we get when we look at the universe is its relationship to change and other information. So our mind is a system that makes models by identifying relationships between changes in inflammation. That's what we do.

Unknown 5:22
Okay, let's slow that down and unpack that a little bit. Because that's very fascinating. So you said we're modeling changes in information?

Joscha Bach 5:29
Yes. So our primary access to the universe is not that we get to experience matter, or energy or sounds or people, what we get is discernible differences. And the fancy name for that is information, right? You can eventually resolve these differences into a little Yes, and knows and maybes. And from these, you construct your model of the world. And you do this basically, by measuring these, as far as we know, differences via your sensory nerves. And they manifest as patterns on your thalamus. And your brain is a machine that counts these impulses on your thalamus to make them predictable to predict future impulses and thereby make sense of them. So basically, if you see a blip on your retina, the meaning of that blip on your retina is the set of relationships that you'll find two other blips on your retina at the same time, or in the future or in the past. And the meaning that you find is a function that describes the origin of these blips as a world with people moving in a three dimensional space and exchanging ideas and so on. This doesn't mean that this reality is really like this, the round was quite different, but it's the best data compression that you find over the blips on your retina. And for those blips where you don't identify such a relationship, or any relationship at all, these are noise, there's a lot of noise in our retina. So the meaningful information is that information for which you can identify a relationship to changes and other information.

Unknown 6:48
And so the brain is been hyper adapted over millions of years to sort of extract information from the noise hitting our senses, and particularly the information that allows us to turn food into babies. Yeah, you could say that. And so how have you been applying this to the AI question?

Joscha Bach 7:09
To me, it's more the other way around. I suspect that AI was started by people like Minsky and during and others, because they realized that psychology isn't going anywhere. At least it was part Minsky's motivation, that he realized that after a PhD in Psychology lost the ability to make progress. And thinking is no longer a vert in psychology. And all this stuff that fascinates us about the mind doesn't really fit into the lap of the psychologist anymore, because they are terrified of overfitting. So they've become an ace theoretical science. And there is a vacuum that is now filled by Buddhist meditation teachers, and that should be filled. I think, by more rigorous science,

Unknown 7:47
Buddhist meditation teachers are not rigorously scientific,

Joscha Bach 7:51
I think that you are probably the exception, I wouldn't necessarily agree. But yeah, because you have to survive other Buddhist meditation teachers, you hang out, right? And they might beat you up in the dark corner, if you tell them what's going on.

Unknown 8:07
So how do you imagine this more vigorous psychology that includes thinking?

Joscha Bach 8:12
So a nice thing about computer science is that the kinds of models that we make have an additional criterion, on top of needing to be capturing the regularities that you observed in the lab, they also need to work. So when we make a model, it's a functional model, we require this model to produce certain dynamics. So our models have to actually reproduce the phenomenon. Which means if they don't we know that our theory is wrong and needs enhancing,

Unknown 8:37
you can actually test and get feedback and make improvements. Yeah, so

Joscha Bach 8:41
if you have an idea on how stereoscopic vision works, we don't test it by taking a bunch of people into a lab and measuring their timing and see if this is congruent with the timing predicted by our theory. But what we do is we implement this and then we see if that thing is able to resolve images that are stereoscopic in towards 3d representation

Unknown 8:59
you implemented as cameras and processors and computers,

Joscha Bach 9:03
yes, but it's something that we consider to be structurally equivalent that is able to capture the necessary regularities.

Unknown 9:09
So it's substrate independent. Yes. This is a core feature of Chomsky. Right? Yeah.

Joscha Bach 9:16
And I mean, philosophically, it's very difficult to say that there is a difference between two systems that produce the same observations, if they're all the same observations, it means that you have no way of not knowing what you didn't explain, which means everything that there is to be explained to cut explained,

Unknown 9:31
right. So presumably, the result of this way of looking at things would be that you could create a machine that was a perfectly conscious human being out of essentially silicon. Yeah, probably not that we can do that or will do that. But theoretically, yes, of

Joscha Bach 9:47
course, we don't make this out of the silicon views the silicon to implement that function as a substrate. Yeah, yes. So there is a difference between the function and the physical thing. So in some sense, a bunch of cells are physical, right? And the organism is not a sum of a bunch of cells. It's not a set of cells. It's a structure of principles that tells the cells how to interact. It's a function to the code. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's a bit of software in a way. It's a virtual machine. What about

Unknown 10:13
your own life or your own experience led you to be interested in this,

Joscha Bach 10:18
I grew up in a forest as the son of an artist in Eastern Germany, we're in Eastern Germany, and you're Yuna and Weimar. Okay, so this area of German Romanticism, it's very beautiful area. And the place where I grew up is extremely quiet. And my father opted out of society is in a way in 1968 person in communist Eastern Germany. And he tried to innovate, built his own universe, because he felt that society wasn't working for him. And it took me a long time to understand that he was basically a one person card. And society at large is many million person called or set of interacting cards. And when you look at this from the outside, it makes it a very interesting perspective.

Unknown 11:03
I'm curious if you feel that or he feels that his one person called experiment was successful,

Joscha Bach 11:09
definitely, I think so. But I'm not sure that he is aware of the fact that it's a cut. Because it's only follower. I mean, it's five plays along. But it's not that she is completely engrossed or enmeshed in it, because he doesn't work for power, he does it to get the ball to work for himself. And it works, though, he has this small kingdom out there in the woods that is full of sculptures and art. And he's super productive. And he's largely very happy. And it's useful to the world around him and the world around him is useful to him to some degree, and nobody knows what the others are really doing. But they only do.

Unknown 11:49
So this cult produced you so there you are born into this forest,

Joscha Bach 11:54
and basically feral I grew up in a large cave full of books

Unknown 11:58
out that sounds kind of like heaven to me. Okay, so there you are in that environment. How do you get from there to MIT,

Joscha Bach 12:06
mostly by being locally incoherent. So you need to strive for some kind of global coherence to explain what's happening to you. Basically, you will get to school for the first time, when you were six years old, you get to meet other kids. And they live in a completely

Unknown 12:20
different universe of saying this all of the second person. So that's fascinating.

Joscha Bach 12:23
Oh, I'm basically trying to give you the idea of what it's like to be in that situation. Because eventually it has very little to do with me, nothing is ever personal, right? Everything is a set of models that you're making. And this illusion that yourself is the agent is not a good reflection of what's going on the self as a passenger and the whole thing. And you could be that passenger to

Unknown 12:44
this is all true. I'm just distracted by my difficulty of doing the math about whether you would have gone to school at that age in East Germany, or if it would have been Germany by then.

Joscha Bach 12:54
No, I'm born in 1973. So reunification happened when it was already in my later teens. So I was old enough to actively participate in the revolution, some of the first flyers for the first opposition parties were printed on my side Kosha printer. Wow, very naive, because we had no idea on how politics and society really works. And we still had this idea that there is some injustice and the way that our local universe worked. And we would need to push a few buttons and make a few changes to get it to oscillate into this larger justice equilibrium where things would work better. And to realize that there are no moral forces in the universe, right? This is all evolution.

Unknown 13:36
So you're firmly materialist in your viewpoint.

Joscha Bach 13:39
I'm a computational list in some sense. So I think that the world can be described as states and transitions between the states. And some of these transitions are deterministic, so you can model them in a probabilistic step is just noise, right? Yeah, all noise is the same means it's incompressible.

Unknown 13:56
And it's not important at our level of experience Correct.

Joscha Bach 14:00
At our level of experience, we construct the idea of matter. If you talk about matter, what we mean is two types of energy in a way there is information oscillating in the same region, this is what we call matter. And there is this parity that propels these oscillations along which is momentum, right. And this is how we construct our idea of energy and matter, we see that there is information that you can locate, and there are trajectories, along which this information moves. And the set of trajectories and locations is what we call space time.

Unknown 14:31
Is that set of trajectories and locations that we call space time is simply a model in our heads. Yeah, yeah. So what in your estimation? Does the quote real world out there look like?

Joscha Bach 14:43
Well, it doesn't look like anything because looking is the process of making a particular kind of model. But if you look at this woman with medical perspective, which means you look at the space of all possible models that can describe it from the perspective of languages. Mathematics is the domain of all formal languages. I think You can say that the universe can probably be described as some kind of graph of some hyper graph in which there are changes that are implemented as the evolution of the structure of that graph. And what

Unknown 15:10
about the laws which govern those changes? Are those just another graph? Or do they exist on a different level?

Joscha Bach 15:16
So basically, what physics is looking for my view is the transition function that correlates adjacent states of the universe. So from the perspective of a system that is implemented in adjacent states of the universe that moves as a trajectory, that universe, as it appears to us, there is going to be a function that tells you how these adjacent states are related. Yes, this is basically Aristotle's prime mover.

Unknown 15:41
Okay, so here we have this, you know, hyper graph, a graph of many graphs. And that's just a way of describing in a way that are limited brains can understand what is going on out there. I know it's a very general

Joscha Bach 15:53
thing. Basically, what it means a graph is a description that you use in computer science to model networks. And a graph is a set of nodes, locations, and links between them. So each link connects a pair of nodes, right? The link is a property of a pair of nodes. And a hyper graph, a link is a property of n nodes. So it's a slight generalization. It's a predicate over and locations. And because we have predicates that connect more than two locations, and University of entanglements that go over many locations, and one natural description is hypergraph. That is just the most general description language that we need to use to describe the phenomena. But it's not sufficient to specify what's going on. There are constraints in that whole thing, right. So for instance, the stuff that we observe is particle dynamics, there is information flowing in packets, through some kind of letters. And we can make the inference for that to happen, you probably need to package the information relayed that it doesn't dissipate when it travels over large distances, which is how you get to basically some kind of standing wave that rotates back into itself. So the information doesn't go away.

Unknown 17:00
We have podcasting to move information over distances.

Joscha Bach 17:03
But we do this with electromagnetism, everything that sexy in this world is electromagnetic, right? When you hear something, when you touch something, when you see something, it's either photons hitting your retina, or it's electromagnetic forces pushing air molecules, or it's electromagnetic forces between your fingers and a surface that you're attaching.

Unknown 17:23
And then these signals that are generated in the senses go through a huge amount of layers of processing in the brain until it becomes something that models our world. Right. That's how we think of a chair as a chair, it's takes a lot of processing to see the visual information or hear someone's hand touching it or actually physically sitting in it, and then translating those signals, comparing them with memories and eventually arriving at the idea that this is a chair that I'm touching or sitting in correct.

Joscha Bach 17:57
It's basically very tempting to think of the universe as something like a fractal, you know, this Mandelbrot fractal, and the readers that don't know it, please look it up on YouTube. It's amazing. So the original fractal in computer graphics, so you basically have a single line of code. And this describes a series that defines our series expands and the series might depending on the coordinates, where you start out with go into infinity, or converge to some finite number. And depending on that, if you have a finite number, you basically set a pixel, if it goes into infinity, you said no pixel. And as a result, you get this very intricate shape. And the shape is infinitely detailed. You can zoom in all you want, and you always find new structure. And even though the Kolmogorov complexity, the algorithmic complexity to produce this function is just one line of code. It's very simple. And when you are in that fractal, if you're like us in a very small region of that fractal, and you don't know where you are, and you don't know the generator function, you cannot predict your local neighborhood from that function. So what you can do only as you look at the local structure, it's not completely random, not completely chaotic, you see, oh, lime appear to be in some kind of spiral. And the spiral continues and gets a little bit narrower to the right. And so you can predict the future. And at some point, there's going to be a singularity where this spiral ends, and you will discover all this barrel ends exactly the moment when it gets very small hits another spiral, right. So you know, find the second law to describe the dynamics in your environment. And most of our models are of that type, they make some local compression. So the world is not completely chaotic to us. But it's not the structure of the universe itself, which is probably much, much more simple.

Unknown 19:31
Yeah. And yet here, we are making models of everything. That's what our learning as a child teaches us to do or provides for us. So our priors on everything are what is important, right? We have to have seen something like it before to begin to make a model of it. And so you know, everything's a metaphor on some level, right? We're comparing it to another chair. We're comparing it to another peach or something. There's a large reliance on learning Well, Are Julian's on priors to help us to navigate what is going on now? And so is it just the case that we need to play quite a bit in order to just accumulate priors? And is that something that you're taking into account in AI.

Joscha Bach 20:17
So I think that the validity of a belief is never independent of its priors, the confidence and the belief should always equal the strength of the evidence to support the belief. It's roughly what bacon discovered in 1600 20, in which in some sense may have triggered an singularity of building a civilization or intellect. Once you realize that there is a role to decide whether something is true, you can basically take this candidate for a role, strength of the confidence must equal the weight of the evidence. And you realize, oh, I need to make a map of all the possible narratives, not just find one, and shift my confidence around and the confidence is that my confidence is and justify them. And you need to track all your priors, you need to track them into your foundations, you need to know what reasoning itself is and what the status of reasoning is, and what alternatives would exist. And once you're done, belief stops being a verb, because the thing that you believe in has no more relationship to you. It's a completely self contained system. So in some sense, you build some mathematical a priori structure, and you'd find all those structures that could explain the observations, they're probably not that many structures, they're not that many mathematical self contained universes, that could explain what's going on. And in a way, trying to find this optimal state of the modeling function. This comes down to a project of building a civilization of intellect that spends much more than one generation. And it's this civilizational intellect is something that normally is not visible to the scientists that work on it, because we all see only a very small fraction of and it's not even clear if the workers here will, eventually fits together. So that mathematical traditions of physics and mathematics, for instance, and the different types of physics and different types of mathematics, do they all fit together into a cohesive building? Eventually, really, there probably will.

Unknown 22:04
So far, no.

Joscha Bach 22:06
Right? Yes, but we are getting closer.

Unknown 22:09
quantum effects and gravitational effects don't seem to match. Yeah, and so on.

Joscha Bach 22:13
Yeah, but this is a minor thing. You know, then Alpha zero, was used to model goal that took 2700 years for people to get pretty good at playing go. Yeah. So they had go schools were very smart, Asian kids were sent to the schools and played a lot of games of goals and thought very deeply about them. And then when they thought about this, they took what they learned from it and gave this to the next generation. And they did this for quite some time. civilizational go intellect. Yes. And then other zero comes there and place a few 100 million games against itself. And within a quarter day, it's telling people Oh, my God, you guys, you were on your local optimum, only some of the things that you found out and saw this is the way to play go wrong.

Unknown 22:54
Yeah, reinvented a whole new way of playing basically overnight, right? Yeah. And

Joscha Bach 22:57
the game of physics that like 170 years old.

Unknown 23:01
So are you hoping to create a physics engine that can solve problems much more quickly?

Joscha Bach 23:07
They might. But when you do something that you don't know how to do? The question is that you eventually don't know how useful your contribution is going to be. And so until we get to some fascinating results, and most of us phone, because so many of us are working on the same questions, we cannot know how significant our contribution is. It's also not that important.

Unknown 23:25
Okay. There's obviously a lot of directions to go here. But I want to keep going along the line of, you know, you go to school and try to figure out what's going on. How did you get from there to, you know, MIT and working on AI?

Joscha Bach 23:39
So in some sense, I realized that when I want to understand what's going on in the universe, when I want to answer the deepest questions that I have, it might be a good idea to study to go to academia, and the best subjects that I found for things like psychology and philosophy and computer science. And I realized that philosophy is not very helpful. I think largely because the incentives are wrong for philosophy in itself, it's useful science. But practically, in Germany, the chance that you get from postdoc to tenure is one and 20, which means a person with a formal education and employable skills, is not going to play that game. And so the philosophers are basically the people without a formal education that only understand the introductory sections of books and papers. And the incentives in the science are that you need to get cited a lot so you fulfill the benchmarks to get promoted to tenure. So people need to find a hill to build a castle on that is very visible, didn't get cited all the time. They also incentivized not to leave that castle ever, even if the hill is indefensible to lose your PageRank Yes, the thing that you basically build something on an hill that is possibly indefensible also means that there's very little progress in philosophy. They're not going to attack your Hill in such a way that you will ever be forced to leave it You can build your castle on indefensible hill, there will still be conferences in that castle and 200 years from now. Right. So there's no learning happening. And you are incentivized to take one of the bad Hills because the good hills are usually already taken. So it also is not really a science anymore. It's a culture and it's a culture of is bad incentives, very hard to do the actual philosophy on the side. Yeah,

Unknown 25:21
it's interesting that philosophy is now moving in a direction where some people are collaborating with science and working in artificial intelligence or working in robotics or whatever,

Joscha Bach 25:32
yes, but might be too negative. And I will probably make all the philosophers hate me. But I suspect that it's very often a cargo cult.

Unknown 25:38
I know what Cargo Cult is. But what do you mean, in this case, basically a

Joscha Bach 25:42
cargo cult? Maybe we should tell it to the listeners. Right? So this is something which happened in Indonesian islands post World War Two, yes, they discovered that there were airplanes dropping goods, cargo on their airports to support the locals in the war effort. And after the war ended, these airplanes didn't show up anymore. So they recreated airports by building from bamboo towers, and they build runways and so on from wooden whatever they found

Unknown 26:11
sort of symbolic towers and symbolic runways in the hope of

Joscha Bach 26:15
attracting new airplanes and your cargo. Basically, they created the appearance of the original thing in the hope that the results would manifest. And I don't know how real this story of the cargo holds radios, because it's way too good to be true. But it's a very good story, right? To illustrate what we mean here, very often you go through the motions of something that appears to be science, in the hope that the results that are generally associated with it will manifest sort of magically manifest. Yeah. And this happens a lot. I mean, a lot of meditation is also a cargo cult, right? What

Unknown 26:48
about yourself? In what way is a lot of meditation, a cargo cult?

Joscha Bach 26:52
Basically, people have realized when you sit down and are very, very quiet and don't say a lot and you have good smells in the air, then your mind goes very empty, maybe yes. And then very good results will happen in your life, like abundance will manifest and your psychological problems will dissolve. And you will become very subtle.

Unknown 27:11
According to this way of thinking you might even directly perceive the truths of the universe. Yeah, yeah, by sitting really still.

Joscha Bach 27:19
Yeah. And of course, this is, in a way a dangerous thing, because it gives rise to some kind of enlightenment industry, for people with defective selves can create enlightenment experiences to insert them in their self narrative.

Unknown 27:32
That is very true. And yet, we can see through the nature of the self, and perhaps help some of the self model to correct itself.

Joscha Bach 27:42
If you see science as a way to reach enlightenment, of course, that's a cargo call tool, because at some point, there are going to be diminishing returns. So building this civilization intellect in itself is a thankless task. There is intellect, this global modeling function in a way is a virtual AI that probably at some point will be a real AI system that finds truth. But it doesn't care like millions of worker ants, yes, and it doesn't care about them. It's not going to give meaning to your existence or reward you for your toilets by itself. But it does

Unknown 28:09
give you ibuprofen, and you know, a refrigerator.

Joscha Bach 28:13
Well, in a way, this is society employing this machine, and this verb is of some regulation. But the machine itself doesn't really care about the iPhone, it only cares about how to make it in a way and why it would work and so on. But it doesn't care about the utility of it as truth itself, is independent of the utility of the truth.

Unknown 28:31
Do we have a general term for the civilizational? Intellect? Do we just call it science? Or do we call it something else? Typically,

Joscha Bach 28:39
in a way, it's already in the founding most of our civilization, you know, this tower of Babel. This is a thing that was built to reach the heavens, right? This is the thing to make the global modeling function. And this project failed because the languages of people started to diverge. So the people working on different sections,

Unknown 28:58
we were intentionally befuddled by the intervention was God very interesting

Joscha Bach 29:02
thing. If you read the section in the Bible, it's not so clear. So in a way, everything in the universe is done by God. So yeah, no, but it's not really clear if God meant this as a punishment of people or to make sure that they don't get there. But it could also be that simply this is what happened because of the dynamics of the universe, the way the universe works. So for some reason, people diverged, they didn't have an internet that would make them converge back them. So they diverge so much that the people working on different sections of that tower could no longer understand each other, and the tower collapsed,

Unknown 29:37
that would be problematic. It's sort of like the transit center in downtown San Francisco.

Joscha Bach 29:43
On the other hand, the Catholics, the people that build the church later on, based on these old myths, they had a different agenda. When Catholicism came about it was in the middle of the failing secular Roman Empire and that decided, let's try to save the civilization by turning it into a cult. So or they took the Hebrew manual of running a desert tribe and modernized it by introducing humanism. So you would not stone all the sinners, but you allow them face to redemption, you would have interface gods, the saints, so people would not all need to identify with exactly the same purposes.

Unknown 30:16
And they copied the political structure of the Roman empire into the

Joscha Bach 30:20
Exactly. And they also have systematically to turn it into a car destroyed people's epistemology. So this notion of how much confidence you should have, in a belief, the weight of the evidence, this notion was changed right? Now suddenly, if somebody comes down from a mountain, having talked to a burning bush and says, I have very good news for you. This is the basic idea of fake news. Yes, and real vague to make that stick. It was required to tell people, you know, the weight of the evidence doesn't actually matter. There are other criteria, which are way more important. And if you don't understand these criteria, people near you to a tree,

Unknown 30:56
or Yeah, burn you alive. So can we say that that civilizational Savior project of turning the Roman empire into a cult was successful?

Joscha Bach 31:05
It's a very hard thing to say. I mean, the Roman Empire failed anyway. And after it failed, it will never go away. Yes, I think the civilization that came afterwards is a different one. The new civilization came from the north, basically, the olive oil people, the civilization completely crashed. Rome was a town of more than a million people. And when it crashed, there was no more city in Europe that had more than 50,000 for quite some time. We lost agriculture, we lost food production, we lost medicine, architecture, irrigation, all these nice things plumping all this was gotten for a long time, it took more than 1000 years to crawl back from the trees.

Unknown 31:44
It took the muddy cheese learning to read some of these texts on architecture. Yeah.

Joscha Bach 31:49
And in between, we had the thing that we are almost eradicated by the Mongolians by the Mongols. Right? It was a accident that Genghis Khan didn't go all the way because he died and everybody was recalled. Otherwise, our civilization would have been eradicated by them completely, very effectively. Yeah, yeah, about turned into something else, of course, like China.

Unknown 32:09
Well, typically, they just left grease spots. I mean, there's that whole civilization, like the Urals and all that that just went away, because the Mongols just completely erased it.

Joscha Bach 32:20
So in a way, there was a very risky thing to do. And it almost failed. We could have all died in a way as a civilization. And we had to invent a new civilization. It's a very weird thing that almost all the good words in English that are not related directly to medieval try to get your foot and part of your foot are that inverts. Yes. And that Indians are not Italian words, Italian is some bastard local dialect that some local poets spoken that spawned again, long after the Latin Empire crash highly

Unknown 32:49
developed pig den of Vulgar Latin. Yeah. Okay, so we keep tending to go off of these very fascinating branches. But let's bring it back.

Joscha Bach 33:01
By all means, yeah. So

Unknown 33:02
okay, let's talk about how you might model a sense of self. Because that's of great interest to me. And I think to listeners, any meditators should be interested in what it means to have a self model and what that's about, and how you might talk about that. And then what we could say, if anything, is meant by awakening, or seeing through the self model. And what comes with that.

Joscha Bach 33:25
Then you look at Cartesian Dualism, this idea that we generally ascribed to Rene Descartes, that there are two domains that are separate, and somewhat independent, the domain of the physical of this stuff in space. Let's extend that. And then the staff have the mental the Thinking Substance, or escargot hands, and they somehow need to interact. And we interpret this as two causal domains that are independent of each other, but somehow magically share an interface. And the design of that interface is very hard, which is why dualism is not a popular theory. But it's still somehow the null hypothesis.

Unknown 34:00
You think this is just a early way of describing substrate independence.

Joscha Bach 34:05
It's interesting to think about it like this. But the best way to make sense of Cartesianism is to say that both res extensa and rest cogat. Hence, this describe mental states, there are some mental states which are percepts, and all percepts relate to regions in the same sweet space. And then there are concepts and ideas and intentions, feelings, and so on. And this is stuff that you cannot map on a region in 3d space. And so in a way rest extends and rescue kittens are two types of mental representations that we all find ourselves immersed in, right? So they're all inside of our brain, along with everything, right? And the Christian epistemology is largely that there is a real world that is inhabited by God and God is a coder. And this quarter has created a virtual world. And we inhabit this virtual world but we are not NPCs we are not non player characters. We are avatars of something that's sitting outside our real bodies, our souls and These worlds remote control these avatars in this virtual environment,

Unknown 35:03
based on our score in that virtual environment, we end up in the heaven or hell realm ranked somewhere.

Joscha Bach 35:09
So we basically live in some kind of World of Warcraft. And God is the programmer of is root access, who created the whole thing. And there's also the devil Devil is a hacker, he also got root access, but he doesn't have the scope of God. So he's mostly gaming the system and cheating a little bit and giving us game money in exchange for our metaphysical currency, our souls,

Unknown 35:28
right, you keep mixing up pokey coins with actual dollars or whatever, yeah, but

Joscha Bach 35:33
there are no actual we all it's all pokey coins. But the meaning of these pokey coins is normally that God wants us to learn to do the right thing to play the right game. So we are fit to progress on to the next level. And in a way, this is the Christian story, right, or a way to reframe that Christian story in something that a coder that is not a Christian would understand.

Unknown 35:53
And really with minor variations, you can apply that story to almost all internalist philosophy.

Joscha Bach 35:59
And it's the null hypothesis of our civilization in a way of our western civilization, that their souls are supernatural things that the physical universe is created by a supernatural being. But I don't think this is the way to make sense of the world. Even though it's our null hypothesis, the guy having come down from the mountain, after having talked to a burning bush never had a case, there was never a null hypothesis. There was never any evidence to support this was only people telling us this because it worked very well for them. And for some of our ancestors

Unknown 36:29
will and having something worked very well is at least its own kind of utility,

Joscha Bach 36:34
right? So dualism is very hard to get to work in terms of building a cohesive theory that explains how the physical and the mental domain interact. And we typically call this the heart problem, right? And then there are two traditional answers in our Western philosophy to the heart problem. One is materialism, the idea everything is physical and produced by the interaction of physical things. And the idea that everything is mental that we basically live in a dream. And that dream itself is dreamt by mind on a higher plane of existence. And we typically take idealism and materialism to be in opposition as theories. And dualism as a way to harmonize them. Yeah. And the

Unknown 37:13
believers of each are sort of at war with each other. Yeah. And

Joscha Bach 37:17
I suspect that the right way to look at this is to see them as complementary as part of the same story. Yes, you and maybe find ourselves in the dream, we actually live in the dream that by magic as possible, that's why we can be conscious and so on. But the dream is grabbed by a mind of a higher plane of existence that is generated and implemented in the brain of a social primate that inhabits the physical universe. So basically, this higher plane of existence is the materialist world, it is the thing that we describe this physical theories. And this is what we forget to tell our kids in the west and in school that we don't have access to reality itself. Reality looks nothing like what we experience it. Reality is a VR generated in our brains to explain sensory patterns.

Unknown 37:58
You've never experienced reality or another person or anything.

Joscha Bach 38:03
Yes, color and sound and people don't fit to your nerves, there's only electrical impulses coming through their nerves, and your brain is counting these nerves. And to make them predictable, it comes up this hallucinations with functions that are people and sounds and colors and ideas.

Unknown 38:19
Now, you and I agree strongly on this. But just since we're having the discussion, aren't we sneaking total materialism in as the root explanation here?

Joscha Bach 38:30
No, it's nothing that you need to assume the idea that the universe is mechanical? is a theory you can test this, it basically means does the universe have a lowest causally closed layer that in itself doesn't care about us? Or is the universe some kind of magical thing in which you have symbolic interaction? So is there a magical word that I can say like times that day like a Minecraft and the sound goes up? That will be a symbolic interaction, right? If you make an incantation, and yes, right. So is this a system that is designed by somebody, and therefore allows you to perform magical interactions? Or is it a system that just is and doesn't really care about us, and we are just a random side effect of that thing? And there is no conspiracy going on? That is something that you can test for. And for me, the surprising thing is that the theory that this is not a conspiracy actually works.

Unknown 39:23
Only someone involved with the conspiracy would say that. Okay, good. So here we have this really beautiful bringing together of materialism and idealism into like a two tiered model, as I understand it, so we're moving towards the sense of self here. Yes.

Joscha Bach 39:39
So the self is the story insight of the VR, the brain is trying to manage the world by creating a model of the world. It's like rendering in a computer game. And this rendering of the computer game contains objects that are being lit and distorted according to the laws of perspective before they reach our center. input. And this allows us to explain our sensory input, right? The explanation for our sensory input is we live in some kind of computer game physics engine that produces these patterns and the world that it's generating. This is a planet in the solar system. And it has these nice properties and these and these elementary parts that move around in this in this way. So this is the kind of model that we generate, and that we can come up with to explain what's going on. But the organism also needs a model of itself and its progress.

Unknown 40:28
In the world of recursive function, this is where it gets interesting. So, of course, the

Joscha Bach 40:33
brain is a physical system, it cannot feel anything, neurons cannot feel anything, just machines. And it will be very useful for the brain to know what it would be like to feel universe interacting. So it creates a simulacrum of this, it creates a virtual person, like a character in a novel to inhabit this VR. And this complete simulation is complete fake, it's a narrative, it's a story that the brain is telling itself about itself. And this self, the brain does things to it, and then sees how the simulation reacts, then this simulacrum gets access to the language center. And here we are, and oh, my God, everything is so magical. And this guy is so blue today. And I have phenomenal experience about this. And how is this even possible, right?

Unknown 41:14
Where do you think the utility or I would say the urge, or the biological wiring arises in evolution to have identity with the story, rather than just having it be useful fiction, we are required to, like inhabit the fiction.

Joscha Bach 41:32
I think as if you stop identifying was the story your evolutionary fitness seems to drop

Unknown 41:37
your motivation doesn't go away, necessarily, but diminishes somewhat, if you

Joscha Bach 41:41
dis identify with the self, then you don't perceive yourself as being that person anymore. It's we call this depersonalization. Right. The difficulty is when you identify with the mind that generates this. So basically, you identify as the function that creates reality, it is very straightforward to gain your reward function, it's very difficult to be motivated by anything, if you can set the conditions under which you exist by just changing the universe that you inhabit, and your relationship to it. Which probably means that you will not jump through all the hoops that you need to jump through to be successful as the evolutionary games.

Unknown 42:16
So you're kind of defining awakening there. But to run the experiment the other way around. Or to describe it backwards, we could say, believing in this model does make you jump through the hoops. And it's highly motivational, which might be the reason that it evolved in the first place.

Joscha Bach 42:32
Yeah, so basically, to make you care about anything to make you give a shit about anything, the organism needs to take a perfectly fine computational process, and fuck it up with the illusion of meaning. And once you identify with this meaning and one or more dimensions, this is in some sense, enlightenment, it's kind of an awakening that takes place. And the more you wake up, the harder it is for the organism to blackmail you into having kids.

Unknown 42:59
So for you, you're How did this awakening unfold this understanding?

Joscha Bach 43:05
I suspect that I mostly stuck around for long enough and not lied to myself too much to understand, basically, Formula theory that would explain the observations.

Unknown 43:15
Okay, so but what does that look like, you know, day by day for you,

Joscha Bach 43:19
and nothing much really, I mean, happiness and meaning are not the result of you understanding anything, they are the result of you looking at swirls and being able to derive enjoyment from this meaning itself is a lot like the ring of Mordor and the Lord of the Rings, you need to carry it very lightly. If you drop this ring, you will lose your mission and you'll lose the Brotherhood of the ring. Like looking for tools or whatever you have to with your friends. And if you put this ring on, you get superpowers but you get corrupted. Yes, right, because there is no meaning objectively. So if you fall for this, it basically blinds you for all the alternatives. And there are systems of meaning that are less or more sustainable than others. And ideally, you want to be in one that is sustainable. But if you completely adopted it will make it much harder for you usually to see other meanings and understand them properly.

Unknown 44:09
Right now, I hear you talking the language of meta systematicity, which is a big theme on the show and which I find very fascinating.

Joscha Bach 44:17
I love it that there's so much convergence. You know, I'm a virgin verse respect to your show.

Unknown 44:22
You've never listened to an episode. So this is the biggest meets

Joscha Bach 44:25
so physical. It's people talking. It's demos, like animals

Unknown 44:30
right in your ear making sounds so god yeah, it might be terrifying. So okay,

Joscha Bach 44:40
I guess it's a habit. You get used to it, like so many things.

Unknown 44:44
Are you familiar with David Chapman's work? Yeah, yeah. So he's a guest on the show. And he's the one who talks the most about meta systematicity and who also like you was an AI researcher at MIT.

Joscha Bach 44:55
Yeah, but I think he had a big accident. No way. Tell me more. So He probably disagrees with this perspective that I have on him. But from where I stand when I look at him, it seems to me that when he worked with Rodney Brooks, who was into this embodiment idea that ultimately is spawned by some intuition that says, pure algorithm does not have the necessary powers to become intelligent or to be a mind in to be in touch with the mystical reality, substantive possibly does more. So we need something that is strongly embodied and grounded in this physical universe. And then we need to make it percolate in the right way, with the subsumption architecture or whatever. And then it becomes the mind and its project essentially failed. It culminated in the Roomba for audiobooks. And for David something, which

Unknown 45:41
is a civilizational achievement. What do you think about it,

Joscha Bach 45:45
Ronnie runs around and writes extremely smart and insightful articles about how AI is not going to succeed ever because him a very smart and insightful person only got a Roomba out of it. That is innovative tragedy, right. It's such a waste of possible intellect that could contribute to get to this insight of how it works. And for David's even worse, because he is very deep and brilliant and philosophically interested. So he realized there must be a way to get to truth and there should be a systematic way to get to truth because otherwise you're pointing the trajectory in the wrong direction. But he realized at some point that he cannot explain the mind, he could not explain what was happening to him, besides rational theories. So at the core of his worldview, now he had suddenly a big gaping hole, he convinced himself that there was no rational way, no completely logical mathematical way to explain the mind. And so he basically backtracked, he left this rational room, close the door, and try to find some other room. And then he jumped into Buddhism, which is like a septic tank. And then he started to use his brilliant mind to clean this septic tank. And when you see this from the outside, oh, my God, look at him go and you really make it do it. But why would you jump to the septic place? If you want to have a sanitary system in the first place, right, you can look from the outside at Buddhism and see which parts work. But after you fix everything, you don't want to jump first into the septic tank and build a working clean system and there. So this is in a way what he did. And because he already has this default, that rationalism doesn't work, He now gets to some kind of what he calls meta rationality. So this meta rationality, of course, must be part of rationality, basic, because if you are a rationalist, and you'll find out that there's a better way to find truth, you're going to incorporate this. So meta rationality is already pre default part of rationality. And for him, it's the attempt to build an alternative.

Unknown 47:36
So you're considering San Francisco as a future location. So if I can get you and David in this studio together, would you be interested in having that conversation? Oh, totally. Yeah, me too. I'd love to hear it. But I can't respond, of course, to your critique of him, it'd be interesting to have him respond.

Joscha Bach 47:53
Yeah, it's positively not even a critique because I deeply respect what he's doing. And I think that he's really brilliant and very, very insightful. And I don't know how canonical is perspective of Buddhism is so it might have permanently burned my ideas of how Buddhism works. Reading is meaningless blog. And the witness

Unknown 48:12
is translating it very idiosyncratically, but very effectively,

Joscha Bach 48:15
right? If he saw it just syncretic and effective, it's also very dangerous, because it's so convincing.

Unknown 48:21
Yes. And also, it is very heretical from the Buddhist perspective. Okay, so let's backtrack. You were saying you're fascinated by convergence. This is how biological organisms, especially human beings, begin to model the world and model themselves and create a sense of self create an AI. And for you simply thinking about this and, quote, not lying to yourself and looking at experience. nakedly, we might say was enough to kind of reveal this modeling function, correct. I mean, we could call that insight practice, right? Where we just seeing what's really going on and being clear and clear about it until sort of the cracks in the whole edifice reveal themselves. And the whole new understanding is arrived at So I'm curious, do you meditate, sometimes? And when you do that, what do you do?

Joscha Bach 49:16
I sit down for the first 10 minutes, I let things come up that one to come up. And I can hear them out. And then I spent the next maybe 20 3040 minutes. This is getting really quiet.

Unknown 49:30
So you're essentially relaxing. Yes.

Joscha Bach 49:34
But I think that's only the first half because the goal is not just to relax things and let go of things but to build useful new structure. And I suspect that I would need some better guidance for this because it's very difficult to do this on yourself. It's like doing surgery on yourself being very relaxed.

Unknown 49:53
Yes. So that is the that is the technique, right? You got to just practice being alert enough. Yes, well still relaxed. But

Joscha Bach 50:01
ideally, it would be very good to do this in the interaction with somebody who holds that space. And to find somebody who would be a good teacher to this was basically working on a similar trajectory as you are. And it's just a few curves down the same line. Yeah, that would be very interesting.

Unknown 50:20
It's a really cool thing that I think existed in the past, but definitely is live feedback meditating where, you know, someone like shinza, and or Kenneth or myself will, you know, actually start you going on a technique. And after about five minutes, sort of ask you how it's going, and provide feedback, and then try this, try that and then spend five more minutes doing that on your own, and then again, ask you how it's going. And this is something that's just completely impossible to do in groups, it's just one on one. For me, it was really interesting and effective, because you don't, you know, spend all these years like I had done sort of lost in the woods, performing the surgery on yourself, right? It's so much more helpful to have this kind of co pilot.

Joscha Bach 51:11
Yeah. They also things that probably can only be done well in groups, I suspect, I'm pretty bad at interacting with groups, most of my good interactions are one on one. And I'd have no difficulty teaching a group and having fun with this group and keeping it interested. But to actually have a back and forth between the group and me, I'm very bad at this. So basically, building a model of a group mind and the relationship of the individuals with the group mind, I think requires being immersed in group interactions.

Unknown 51:41
Yes. Okay. So couple of things, one, for people who, let's say, are not as immersed in the details of the creation of minds as you are, what's the core thing that they need to understand from what your research has shown and what your ideas lead to?

Joscha Bach 51:59
The organism has a bunch of needs needs are things that give you pleasure. And so when you fulfill them in displeasure, when you frustrate them, basically, pleasure tells you do more of what you're currently doing. And pain tells you do less of what you're currently doing. But you cannot really act on the satisfaction or frustration of needs, because then this manifests. Like when you have your orgasm, everything is done already that led to this right. So when you have your reward, you're already there. And so you need to act based on anticipated reward and anticipated punishment. We are planning Yes, yes. So you don't act on your needs, you act on your models of your needs, and we call them purposes, right? So the purposes are doing effective forecasting, yes, are the things that we think we need to reserve in order to regulate our needs. And so for instance, survival is not a neat, it's way too complicated for reptilian brain to understand the nature of life and death. But it's a purpose. It's a model that you may have all your needs. And you realize, oh, I need to survive in order to serve all my other things. And so you actively can plan for your survival. But survival is really not a neat, it's a purpose, it's a model of your needs. And the self is the result of constructing a hierarchy of needs to make them accountable to each other, because these needs conflict. And so you What are all these purposes and saturate that they become compatible with each other. And then you will discover that there is a function that integrates the expected reward over the next 50 to 90 years. And this is what we call the ego. And if you were a singleton organism or a sociopath, this is sufficient, this is the highest function that you're going to serve. But if you are a part of a group, and you are not a sociopath, you will have functions above the level of the ego that you're serving. For instance, you can have relationship goals, the relationship with your children or your partner with your friends. And this means that you now have a purpose that you can share with others. And the discovery of this shared purpose is at the root of love that you see a system that is above the ego. And you see this other one is serving there too. And this means that you can visit integrity, give them stuff without expecting anything in return. Because by supporting them, you were furthering your own purposes above the ego. And when you go beyond this, and you don't just do this for a small group, or a family or a tribe or a clan. But you do this for a very large system of people like a state, you have something like a god,

Unknown 54:19
the proverbial something larger than yourself. Yeah. So God is basically the

Joscha Bach 54:23
identification of a super organism from the perspective of the individual a function that tells the individual what it needs to do to serve that super organism to be good to be virtuous. And the soul is the sense the relationship to God this projection that the individual makes. And to make this God really effective, you can make a transcendental which means we basically define it as a function that integrates the expected reward from here to eternity, which means most of the reward is outside of this universe. And if we serve this eternal this function, we now have a transcendental meaning function that you cannot possibly satisfy, which is a small part If you really, really look closely, but most people don't really need to look closely. So our highest meanings are like celestial poles that we use for navigation. If you get too close to them and jump into them, we would burn like the moss in the light. But as long as we are distant to them, they are stars that we can all use to synchronize our navigation. So in a way, this defines our relationship to these metaphysical meanings, yes, right. Now, there is also a more practical sense in which God is the Creator, the author of the self, and the universe that we are in this is in a way the mind and the mind is of course, not identical with this projected meaning, but there is a similarity, because if you are able to change your mind, about things, you will change your relationship to reality and reality itself, because the self gets created in different way. And what reality does twist with this virtual world does to the self is also going to change. And the Self cannot directly change this right, the self cannot change its relationship to reality, because otherwise, you would gain your modeling or your your regulation of the mind. But you can use rituals to influence the mind. You can innovate, pray to God, you can lay the fire and will shamanic dance, and use strong symbols to influence the way your reality is constructed, and what it does to you. So in this sense, magic is possible and subjectively, you will have the impression that this God that you are talking to, is not inside of your brain, even though it probably is. But it feels like it's above reality, above the physical universe, and below the game that you are meant to play, while being in this physical universe and that the physical universe is meant to serve subject is it feels like God is outside and above the physical universe. But the physical universe that we subjectively interact with, is the creation of our neocortex. Yeah, the whole world is inside your mind. Yes, into everyone's mind, and it's a different one in everybody's mind. I think this brings us to the notion of non duality. And this is sometimes understood as realizing that we are separate conscious beings is an illusion. And we are all the same consciousness looking out of different eyes. And there is another notion of non duality, which is what you describe as this awakening, where you will realize that everything is a representation inside of your mind. And I think the letter one is more truthful. The former one is basically just the obliteration of the dimension in which we represent separation. And that's very pleasant, because the pain of separation disappears, suddenly, if this dimension is relaxed, you suddenly feel a strong sense of connectedness, where before we had an absence of connectedness and need for connectedness. And if you're do this in a group of people that makes this experience together, and they stop representing this difference, can feel extremely pleasant and true, and more natural. Just it's normally not sustainable. Because we are separate, we do have separate interests.

Unknown 58:03
Yes. And a big part of the practice of that way of understanding non duality is just to reassert the non separation verbally over and over. So it's kind of a mental self programming.

Joscha Bach 58:16
You're still mean?

Unknown 58:17
I am. Yeah,

Joscha Bach 58:19
yeah, but it's true. So in a way, it's about creating better structure. I think that it's important to realize when you interact with others, that everybody in a sense, is you on a different timeline. Yeah. But you need to flip a number of bits to be that other person. And that might turn you into somebody who's extremely dangerous to your own interests,

Unknown 58:36
right? It's really fascinating to think that here you have the realization you see through the self representation. And I do think there's a big utility in that, even if it can reduce biological fitness in another way, it's a huge advantage, especially in reduction of suffering, but then to take that realization and do this other step, which is almost insane when you think about it, and to think, oh, that means that really, the whole external world, really, is that rather than just understanding, oh, this is a process inside my brain. It's like a step too far. Right? And I'm not sure I understand how the universe works. I'm not positive, I have the correct model of anything, really. But it's interesting to me that a lot of the people who are convinced of that way of seeing that it is true that there are no separations in the external world, spend a lot of time trying to prove it, you know, and don't seem to be able to,

Joscha Bach 59:40
there are diminishing returns in physics and not in the sense that it is not going to be super useful to get foundational physics right because it is going to have tremendous applications. But whether the universe is hyper computational, like quantum mechanics is basically hyper computational or if the universe is discrete computation as Stephen Wolfram things are or the universe can be completely derived from number theory, as Dennis Morris suggests, this doesn't make any difference, right, we are in some kind of machine. And this machine is probably generated by some automaton ticking away in the void. And that automaton probably doesn't care about us. Everything else doesn't give good results in terms of predictions. and Dow the exact nature of the automaton doesn't make much of a difference for you realize what's going on is evolution, the meaning of life is on this planet to hydrogenate carbon dioxide to close some chemical reaction change that can only be closed by controlled reactions. So this is our market opportunity as living organisms, we can make controlled reactors, so we can outcompete some damn chemical reactions and use this energy to build our own structure. Yes, and it only works for a while. So we have this puddle of negentropy that we can drain and when it's drained, we will drown in entropy,

Unknown 1:00:52
right, we're not efficient enough to keep it permanently. Yeah, basically,

Joscha Bach 1:00:55
if you want to have dynamics that are separate from the underlying reversible dynamics of the universe, that's why entropy is a threat to us that eventually will get us your small incrustation on the entropic tides of the universe. And the meaning of our existence, in some sense is to eat. And it's very disheartening because it means that we are a type of yeast, all the amazing complexity that we create in our lives and the civilization whatever, is to create some surfaces on which we can out compete other kinds of yeast. Now what we can do is we can do something else we can serve a conspiracy. For instance, the arts, nicest conspiracy, I know it's the cuckoo child of life in its origin. It comes from the machine learning system, falling in love with the shape of the loss function itself. It's as you start thinking that mental representations are intrinsically important. Now the purpose of mental representations is to make you eat more, of course, right? It's a tool for learning,

Unknown 1:01:49
turning that food into babies. Yes, right. But if

you see that the beauty of this thing and you realize, oh, my god, capturing conscious states is much more significant than to eat. You basically turn from an orc into an elf. Turn into somebody who creates magic in their minds, like palaces in their minds and show them to each other. And we sing and we dance. And this is the only reason why we eat right, we only eat to make art make somewhere else. Right. And it's different from kitsch. Kitsch is generated by the self art is generated by the mind. Art captures some kind of truth that captures a certain conscious state of feeling of what it's like. That's the purpose of art. Whereas kitsch captures a story about what we think we want to be true. So it's very separate, you often see that children are very good at making art. And most of the stuff that we give to them is kitsch. Because especially in the US people are afraid that kids cannot handle the truth because it's debatable. Harsh.
