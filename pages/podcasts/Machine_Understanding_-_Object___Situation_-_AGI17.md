Unknown 0:11
Alright, folks. So we'll get started with the workshop part of our workshop.

Unknown 0:20
This is where I get asked questions.

Unknown 0:25
So, we have a set of four focus topics, which are described at the highest level with a couple of two concepts. This one is object and situation. And we've listed a few catalyzing questions to get the conversation started. These are also going to help us sort of try to have a semi focus to this, this interaction because I think it's easily could veer off off path so that you have some sort of a direction, although I'm not sure right now, how direct that direction will be. On the panel, we have Paiwan, David Cronenberg, Yoshida, and Tom Everett. And this is also his first part. And in fact, in all of the sessions, four sessions will, which will be each roughly about 20 minutes, you can ask the panelists questions about their own work, if they gave a talk earlier, you can ask them about that. But ask the panelists to try to keep the answers short, so that we can get any questions from the audience. There's another part to this, which is we will also open up the floor to the audience answering questions from the audience. So it's not really thought of necessarily as a panel of experts who will now answer your questions, but rather as a guideline so that you can make some people happy. So let's get started. I just want to go through these questions first. And maybe ask the panel to say a couple of things about them. Any one of them or all of them? And then we'll open the floor

Unknown 2:22
up the microphone to the panelists. That microphone Yeah,

Unknown 2:26
that's a good idea actually. Yeah. So So, the question we have listed for this session as a guiding light are as follows is it meaningful to say someone understands an object? How is that different from understanding a situation so in other words, the process of understanding directed to an object versus situation? Third, can a real world situation ever be fully understood? I think pay actually touched on that a little bit. Are situations the same as arrangement of objects? Are situations basically composed of an arrangement of objects with some constraints or or maybe maybe rules are situations different from events? Or in other words, were just time factor into this and less than two a context and a situation imply the same thing or something different? If so why but now let's go through really quickly if you if you like any of these and when it comes to queries you don't like any of them and you want to comment on why

Unknown 3:45
yeah

Unknown 3:47
clearly is meaningful to say someone's object the difference between uptrend situation you're my motto is a high level they're the same as I said, obviously, no one wants that is eventually represented as a concept. But of course, there are difference say off janitor focus on this some entity or environment that maybe typically there are multiple entity ways relationships among them. But that difference to me is secondary. real world situation ever be fully understood or not? I already explained that situation the same as object against the same thing at a higher level. They're the same, but you did How's all of their different situations different from events? Similar question. They're both represented by concept by the event typically, when we use that word, I mean, time, matters of situation. Sometimes time matters sometimes doesn't. To a contract situation implies the same thing or something different. I already use this tool in this in this context or situation, I use them as an effect. There are some subtle difference. But

Joscha Bach 5:10
of course, these notions are used in common language, which means they are very ambiguous. And everybody understands something slightly different about them. And ultimately, this whole thing refers to very basic questions of epistemology. And the epistemology that I would use for all these things to describe them is roughly as follows. When we describe the world, we usually do so based on discernible differences that we see in any given moments is the element of observation. And these discernible differences. The fancy name for that is information can be measured in bits, and so on. And if you have a bunch of these samples of these discernible differences, they describe a state where it's absent of a state, because usually cannot sample the whole state. And when we model any part of the world, we usually do so by identifying a transition function that explains the relationship of these states to each other. And if we can fully explain the transition function between the states that we use to model a part of an arbitrary system, we understand the system at some degree. And then we understand the new system, we usually do so by mapping it onto a system that we already understand. That is one basic system, the most elementary system of all, and that's primary computation. So basically, it's something where you describe the world as a set of states and the computable transition function, if you don't have to compute to get from one state to the to another. And when I send this basic epistemology, I can start answering these questions. I can, for instance, Matt, thanks for saying that a situation is a state in episode or a sequence is a succession of situations. Or you could also say that, from some perspective, you collapse the time dimension and you call the whole thing, a situation. And an object is something that can be part of the situation, so you can access it and use it in different situations again, and this also means that situation objects are under certain circumstances interchangeable, because the situation is a particular kind of object, an object is a particular kind of situation. But an object has to implement a certain interface, which means you can access it from that situation, and use it another one.

Unknown 7:49
That's pretty good.

Joscha Bach 7:51
Okay, for now, okay, then I'll stop at this. I'm looking for everyone.

Unknown 7:58
Okay. Just Just briefly, I think European, his talk really touched on really well, the idea that you can't complete understanding is kind of this goal that's never really reached, that we kind of work incrementally to ever trying to understand something toward that direction. In terms of situations and objects. I mean, my opinion there is that, you know, a collection of objects, as a situation becomes somewhat more complex and maybe qualitatively different in that now you have agents trying to navigate or something else, and environment. And I'll pass it because

Unknown 8:48
Thank you. So I'm mainly up here to answer questions about my talk, because I thought extensively on understanding but I think it's, it's really important if you can test for understanding because it helps AI safety. But that's about my my point of view.

Unknown 9:07
Right, so please come up if you have questions.

Unknown 9:20
So maybe it's just

Unknown 9:24
about you please stand behind in the lecture. We can't I can't see you with a beer that makes you fill up behind the lectern. I have to be correct about this. Otherwise, the video we can see.

Unknown 9:39
So just on the first question, it says, understanding an object in English, I'm not sure that that's something something he can say I'm not sure I can say I understand the chair.

Unknown 9:54
So I understand the chair

Unknown 10:00
Senator, I understand how chairs used, I understand what a chair is for I understand how chairs made but

Joscha Bach 10:09
understanding a chair,

Unknown 10:12
you start the chair until you become one with the substance of the chair.

Unknown 10:18
No, I think that's a good point. And I think by that question that that's more what, at least I'm thinking about is that it's not so much understanding the object in and of itself. But for the purposes of utility, what can you do with it? How does it work? How can it be modified or changed or use for something else, is what I think is the most important component of understanding objects in that sense.

Joscha Bach 10:50
The problem was the chair is it doesn't do very much, there are not many interesting state transitions involved in a chair. So as a chair is not really a process. The chair is something like composition of features that are composed in a particular way. I think it's fair to say that I understand what defines a chair, I now understand what you mean by a chair, for instance. But it's not the same thing as saying, I understand the fourth statement. The fourth statement is also an object, but it does something there's some process involved. And once you are able to disentangle the process that's involved in there, you understand this particular kind of object. So what you will do to doesn't mean that objects in general cannot be parsed like this. But there is a difference between addressing an object that is simply a compound of features or an understanding something that has to be mapped on underlying processes.

Unknown 11:47
might turn out, okay, thank you. I have to say, I really appreciated your presentation. I really, really love the experience, what grounding system totally eliminates any portions from the hard problem. Joshua, if you care to how you were doing an excellent job of throwing, right, make the computer subjective, you have more to say I appreciate it very. Well, they don't need that clearer. No,

Joscha Bach 12:16
no, it's not clear what the content of your question is.

Unknown 12:21
So I wasn't really asking you a question I was just inviting you to, to discuss more, as you were discussing any random rapid, when you were getting a very nice discourse on the nature of objects and situations. I thought that was very good, because there was so much ambiguity in that, and I thought you're doing a good job of articulating the differences.

Joscha Bach 12:37
Thank you. But you were supposed to pretend that you have a question.

Unknown 12:51
I have a question, which is related to these topics, but maybe digs down a little deeper, which is something that I've worried about a bunch in recent work with, with opencog, which is that I'm going to add a primitive practical level, when you have an AI system that's just taking in pixel data, I mean, recognizing that such things as persistent objects actually exist is itself a similar difficult cognitive problem. And then related to that, is recognizing that coherent events exist, right, like so, like looking at me now, there's the object of this coffee cup, and now it's gone. Now you guys are thinking the same coffee cup, and I'm not a good enough magician to trick you with waving my hand up and down. I mean, there's a persistent event there that you can say, Well, okay, there's some surprising this at the beginning and end of the event or something. So that's how we know we know there is an event there. But that's also can be a bit tricky. Some of the event may have disappeared and come back and then situations of course, they're also coherent in that same ways objects and events, maybe but they and they can persist like the situation of the panel discussion is one thing, the situation category, panel discussion is another thing and these get more and more complex, but at the very basic level, even like, recognizing that this cup is an object or Josha is an object from like the visual and auditory sensation point of view. So it seems to me that the understanding of of an object and an AGI system, I mean, if you know how the AGI system like recognizes that the object exists in the first place. That goes a long way toward understanding how that AGI system understand Yeah, because I mean on the face of it, and they just, it's just processing a stream of data. It wouldn't need to construct the concept of objects, right? Like it really like if you have an AMC system processing the stream of data and choosing actions. Is there an up? Is there the object of the cop implicit in its predictive model? Or, or isn't there, right? Or, hey, it's itl, or something. But in Nars, or opencog, or microbe sigh, I guess, even just given the stream of data, it's going to construct the concept of the of the objects. So yeah, I'm interested just to, to the extent you can reconstruct it in your mind, within your respective ad systems. If the ad system was just given streams of data, what is the process by which it constructs? An object is something that's worth representing? or manipulating then after that, we can go on to the events or situations, but I'm doing this hard enough. That's the whole question. Yeah, Tom can answer it for AIX, I have to

Unknown 16:11
guess on my part, I guess you already know what I'm going to say. First, continue with what I said in the morning. To put it in a stream, I think all the objects actually exist in the mind, not in the world, the world will provide the material. So what are ways we colonize? Or what do you assign? It's basically the identity of object how to recognize that. It's basically three Americans or the relatively stable patterns in for the subway, and we'll binaries or whatever. And also, it's a matter of degree once again. So there is your audience some kind of threshold, when they say, and they say in a seminar enough, I also there's probably a temporal spatial continuity, and then they'd recognize it as one. But when they change enough, we're going to stop there say even sometimes you may say someone you didn't know flexible, like Ben doesn't look like that anymore. Today is

Unknown 17:13
the caterpillar this object is

Unknown 17:15
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So so to me, it's kind of like something continuous. But sometimes for practical purposes, we have to come somewhere, we'll say, This Is Us MCA. And that is not the same thing at all. anymore, but they're still relative to the premier one

Unknown 17:31
question and to do with this smart system, like NARS is to what extent does that cutting rely on sort of sub symbolic number crunching from the perceptual data? And to what extent is the coding as symbolic operation? And what kind of feedback is there between sub symbolic and well, it's symbolic operation,

Unknown 17:52
I put he currently I'm taking the very extreme position, I don't really distinguish symbolic and sub symbolic anymore, you know, suddenly, you find somebody in power. So everything is a term, you can't have a karmic term, you can have a compound term, if we really get new low level input into it. A pencil can be a term The term is nothing but an internal ID of a pattern, okay. So it can be an individual cannot be further divided signal, or it can't be

Unknown 18:24
a symbol in the sense of semiotics is something that can be manipulated flexibly within the system have

Unknown 18:33
to do have that you can still have that the only difference the major difference is what I said that symbol is not something which is a label of existing outside object anymore, as far as who came up that was in terms of neuroscience, primary data structure is a symbol

Unknown 18:52
of semiotics, if you like proceed semiotics, which you're familiar with, you can distinguish icons, indexes and symbols, different types of signs. And in that sense, not everything is a symbol,

Unknown 19:03
well, I'm not going to make that distinction anymore.

Unknown 19:07
Yeah, even even that semiotic display, I

Unknown 19:09
think, this is still a little bit too macho, I will just say it I'm gonna sing again. As far as I have some kind of handle within the system, which is consistent, poor degrade. And you you can say that, or at least I will Totana term I will be careful about the use of the word symbol. That word how we load a lot of material in but

Unknown 19:34
I mean, if I go back to Paris or something like a stop sign, spaceships are poorly correlated with the thing that's supposed to Yes, whereas the word stop in the abstract discourse is not specially to cover other things. Okay, who would have called the stop sign in index? Yeah, we've had to do that symbol, right. So

Unknown 19:55
for example, if I say the word and say chair you You know, I don't call it a symbol anymore. I can say as a term, but the term already have some grounding. But they're still pure symbols. And I find some hope, the letter X, which has died for different say, we can do call that pseudo symbol,

Unknown 20:16
but then it was a setting aside the terminology, then I guess I would rephrase my question like, to what extent is the partitioning off of some sensations or some classes of sensations into an object? To what extent is that the result of reasoning about things that are fairly simply defined in terms of the persons who are as to what extent does that require more abstract concepts?

Unknown 20:43
I can't even allow Bolsover I can't allow something to be both a single symbol or a single item, also a structure of managers. So my point is, you don't have to always draw a sharp line between what is objective and what is not objective. It just something. Yes, it's pretty

Unknown 21:08
clear to everyone here like, this isn't. This is

Unknown 21:12
the principle the drop in is a broken on the same object, the broken or you have multiple objects?

Unknown 21:20
Many cases, yeah, but yet, there are so many

Unknown 21:24
extreme cases, and there'll be new and all this thing is stable enough. And that the same thing is true for the concepts in ours, you already may say is the same concept, even though each inference I probably changed a little bit, and I will say is still the same.

Unknown 21:40
There's also more abstract objects and the object of discussion. Yeah. And to what extent is it the same criteria?

Unknown 21:48
Well, it's a matter of degree or flexible. Is this our current discussion? The same discarded as a previous conversation? Or is two separate discussion?

Unknown 21:58
Yeah, yeah. So I guess what, what interests me from an engineering view is like, what specific criteria are used to make that distinction?

Unknown 22:08
Yeah, I don't think there is sufficient necessary condition. For something to be taken to be after that it's a blurry, it's funny. I will tell

Unknown 22:21
you what, what would be the what would be the fuzzy criteria for taking something is

Unknown 22:27
similarity, similar enough, pull the premieres like this, the image again, the visual image is similar enough

Unknown 22:35
to identical twins may be more similar than you know. And you know,

Unknown 22:39
but they're different location, if they're in different locations, I have another attribute to distinguish.

Unknown 22:45
So that some codes have similar the more than others.

Unknown 22:48
Not really. In that situation, though, it's not pure a seminar. If you have twins, why show up, then another one go out of the door and come back. Right.

Unknown 22:59
But talk about yourself 10 years from now, we're not that similar either

Unknown 23:03
depend on our discussion for some discussion, I will say is the same person and for some other discussion, I will say they're two different entities, even though they happen to to be continuously ourselves.

Unknown 23:18
Before we go to the next one, are there any questions from you guys? On this particular discussion? Yeah, that was pretty interesting.

Unknown 23:31
Okay, so

Unknown 23:32
disappointing for us. I'm just saying I don't have to keep reminding people, but if you want to use a camera, you have to stay behind the lens, you don't

Joscha Bach 23:42
want to close it to us.

Unknown 23:48
I have a couple of a few different questions, but I guess we're currently very tight on time. Go ahead and do so. The first is more, it's sort of like white frame it as a question, but it's more of an idea, which is, sometimes it's we use physical metaphors to deal with conceptual ideas like that, you know, John grabbed the idea out of the air. Right. So the idea is, is is, is metaphorically representatives as an object, so that it's easier for us to to, you know, to to be able to see it in our minds. And so perhaps not for Joshua. But the like, you know, to be able to to spin it around and with the with the idea of say for instance, understanding the chair, which may be maybe the role of something like I said, so this is kind of the second part, which is the I guess Sometimes if you take, I'm not quite sure everybody willing, when you talk about a term, what you actually mean? Like if I say, for instance, if I, if I have the symbol bag, I can't, the, like, the person can't understand it, unless it's represented in no round with the related objects, you know, like, I backed the plane, or I'm sitting on the riverbank, or I went to the next to withdraw some money. You know, you can't, without the context of the objects around it, it doesn't make any sense. You can disambiguate the sounds. And but there's also the sense of self has an identity, which is independent of the term temperature, it's just a label. So I guess my my question in that particular case, is, Are you like, I think sometimes people are if they conflate the label with the underlying object, which has its own underlying unique identity. So

Unknown 26:13
yeah, I think, first, I need my first term, well, technically, you can just sing this ID. Okay, so you can have ID or something, of course, ID or something. And typically a data structure, saying, What are you sad is completely makes complete sense. The only difference? For example, when we say pan, there are two different image related words, in our speakers do have that. But difference is, I'm not saying that a bank is a financial aid role or a pan by the river has to objects out there. No, they're also ideas in your mind. But of course, it's not unrelated to the outside of the class, eventually they come from the interaction with the world, but I do not assume there is an object there there under your name, it just a label, we will talk to those why they will talk to this one is that I just say there are three cool serie concepts. So your bank may be related to this concept of a financial Yes, they do, or to the concept of a rubberband. But they still fit into the semantic zipper. Why?

Unknown 27:31
Maybe on that note, you're sure.

Joscha Bach 27:35
There's, of course, a distinction between conceptual representations and the underlying stuff. Think in our mind, the generators, probabilistic algorithms that produce the mental simulations that we perceive as being the world. Basically, living this dream that is generated by the neocortex is the result of operators that we can train our brain does that produce dynamic structure, and the sensorimotor scripts describe different domains of the world that we want to model and concepts on the address space of the sensorimotor scripts. contents are a manifold that is shared between speakers because they get bound to linguistic symbols. And linguistic symbols exist in families of speakers. And for that reason, you can infer the structure of the conceptual manifold just by looking at the statistics of language that is, which is why these vector space translation models work so well, or machine translation, they're not perfect, because they cannot do the mental simulations that are behind these things. But they can roughly get the relationship, the bilateral relationships, that conceptual space between the different concepts that exist, they don't get the content of these concepts they cannot simulate. And you talk about King and Queen, one king and the queen looks like a look alike and how they actually interact and so on and so on. So then I call this operational knowledge. Now when we understand things, we make a model of things. And I think we have to understand this distinction between model and implementation. Whenever we talk about a domain, we assume that there is a ground truth and that domain, which means there is a particular way in which it is realized, there is a particular way in which the universe computes that particular thing to compute might sound and so specific, but it's not specific. It's just a clear way of talking about there is a set of discernible differences and changes in a particular way. This is someone realized in the universe. However it is, this is what it is, it's necessary and sufficient that this happens, there is some computational thing that we are describing, even if that thing does not really exist, but that's what we want to model. And now our model can be one possible model that explains possible implementation. But there is of course, as we can show, usually an infinite number of possible implementations, which means you have a very, very large space of models that are potentially valid. That doesn't mean that everything is the other there's only a particular set of particular processes that Introduce the phenomena that you observe for that domain. And the full understanding of the domain means that you understand the shape of this complete subspace of valid models. That's my Marvin Minsky said you only understand the thing, if you understand it, the least we can say. So you base, of course we base is not sufficient, but it means that you get a feeling for the space of possible explanations for that space. And usually the content and we say any of one possible model, then we understand it, then we're very lucky, right? And now understand, say the lambda calculus, I understand computation. But if I understand the Turing machine, and if I understand the type, the untyped lambda calculus and if I understand probability and many others, I get a much much better understanding of computation, it turns out there's an infinite number of possible equivalent definitions of computation and when you understand them all you can understand this complete subspace you have a full understanding. And now if we want to translate this into a cognitive architecture, it gets tricky, right? How do we model for instance and relationship between a concept and the space of possible understandings instead of just one? How do we switch from them? How do we do model revision and so on? Okay, so good.

Unknown 31:15
Tom, do you remember Ben's question? So yeah.

Unknown 31:23
conception of objects. Yeah. So

Unknown 31:25
how does it make sense that the teacup

Unknown 31:29
X is model of the teacup the computer

Unknown 31:33
so thank you for the train I think would have a like a compact representation of the universe like the site some some small set of natural laws and like the initial conditions of the Big Bang, for example. And then from there, everything will derive so there will be no Jacob in that sense in that you can identify easily but on the other hand, you will have a perfect understanding of the teacup in the sense that it will perfectly predict like if I put in like put it upside down the contract and that's it that's the topic I'm standing under

Unknown 32:09
Yeah, now probably X ETL or big T you know love the same property Yes. As you do curious to know that actually will have to make a representation of the Chico but probably didn't yet it's so smile, but none of the nice theories I guess. I

Unknown 32:29
was interesting. Yeah, I could see your personality and couldn't have been more sensible.

Unknown 32:41
Alright, so I kicked the switch out to

Unknown 32:44
second
