00;00;02;29 - 00;00;27;08
Speaker 1
This is my conversation with Joscha Bach, a German cognitive science and intelligence researcher. Yoshio has a M.A. in computer Science from Harvard University, Berlin, and a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from Osnabr√ºck University. Marcus taught computer science and cognitive science at the University of Berlin and the Institute for Cognitive Science at Open Book. He worked as a visiting researcher at the MIT Lab and Harvard Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.

00;00;27;16 - 00;01;05;07
Speaker 1
Joshua then joined a foundation working as VP of Research. He's currently a principal engineer at Intel Labs Cognitive Computing Group. Mark Bird Microbial is a cognitive architecture extending representation of the PSAT or even taxonomies into heard and linguistic labeling. Microbial spreading activation network allows for neural learning, planning and associative retrieval. He has also worked extensively on novel data compression algorithms with using concurrent entropy models.

00;01;06;11 - 00;01;22;19
Speaker 1
I just want to start off like right from the beginning. You grew up in Germany and you have a very different upbringing from like gender, public. Can you just give me a little bit of background on how this mine was created?

00;01;22;28 - 00;01;51;26
Joscha Bach
Well, grew up in communist Eastern Germany. I was born in 1973 and my father was an artist and sort of a hippie. He did not feel that he got along with society at large. The things that he was interested in were not completely aligned with debate in which society was right. And so he removed himself from it and got a larger meal in a very beautiful remote study and then did his art for all of his life.

00;01;51;26 - 00;02;25;20
Joscha Bach
And still does to this day. And I grew up in this very beautiful and somewhat remote place, and I spent a lot of time in nature and enjoyed this very much. And on the other hand, I didn't have many people to talk to, so I got bored and I started to read. And by the time I got into public school, I had read many of the books I the fourth grade and science fiction and other stuff, but the house was full of books and in some sense I was lost for the education that my teachers tried to give me.

00;02;26;17 - 00;03;01;05
Joscha Bach
And my intuition was usually when teachers say something that they are either confused or they're lying, and that it was because I was quite immature. Of course, I was a young child that did not know how other people operated, and so I was unable to speak my mind about me. And until I got into a school for mathematics and sciences in ninth grade, I basically met nobody that I had the impression that I could interact with on any meaningful level.

00;03;01;20 - 00;03;27;29
Joscha Bach
And so I basically was an autonomous mind. I was looking at the world from the perspective of an outside observer of an alien, and that was exacerbated by living in a communist country where the epistemology was weird because it was a highly ideological society in which philosophy was always seen through the lens of a vulgar interpretation of Marxist Leninism.

00;03;28;13 - 00;04;04;09
Joscha Bach
And so everything was seen from whether it was reflecting the role of the working class in the proper way and having philosophical conversations and so on. It was an academic philosophy and so on was difficult. I was strongly influenced by the ideas of sabermetrics. For instance, authors like Stanislaw Lem, a Polish science fiction author who basically formed a lot of the ideas of the 1960s in his own mind and then decided that he didn't want to go into academic cybernetic research because the time was not right yet.

00;04;04;09 - 00;04;30;25
Joscha Bach
And instead he tried to influence the world by writing stories and philosophical parables. And I also read many of the classics in that time. It was like a sponge and when I left school, I thought about what to do next. And I was most interested by the idea of understanding how our own minds work. And there was just something that fascinated me from a very young age.

00;04;31;16 - 00;04;53;14
Joscha Bach
I was sitting in the early 1980s and 1983, roughly in front of a Commodore 64. I taught myself how to code and I had realized that everything that I could fully understand, I was able to put into this computer within the limits of the hardware, of course. But I realized that there would be faster computers with more memory available at some point in the future.

00;04;54;02 - 00;05;24;23
Joscha Bach
And I was wondering what what if I could what what is that I would want to put inside of the computer? And the answer was the whole universe. In a world that is interesting and fascinating and the universe was populated by interesting minds that I could talk to. And that fascinated me. Also, this perspective of understanding that if I can put the mind on the other side of a screen, it also means that I am in the category of things like this.

00;05;24;29 - 00;05;54;28
Joscha Bach
Everybody who looks at the world is looking at the world. So some kind of screen, our retinas, that projection pattern from the universe into our minds and our minds learn how to interpret these patterns and make sense of them. And behind this screen, there are other people, obviously, and I'm one of these. And so understanding who we are also probably best done from this perspective, from this constructive perspective, from the causal structure that is embodied in this idea of software.

00;05;55;01 - 00;06;16;12
Joscha Bach
And I thought, okay, I want to figure out how this works. The best way to do this is probably not art because it does not give me the tight interaction with the substrate and the necessary interaction with other people that I need. And as I thought, I go into academia and then I studied all sorts of things that were related to this specialty computer science and philosophy.

00;06;16;13 - 00;06;35;27
Joscha Bach
And there's a bit of psychology and neuroscience and physics. And I found that the perspective of artificial intelligence was the only one that seemed to be productive because neuroscience mostly didn't seem to have quite the models about how the mind works and was not so much thinking about minds, but about neurons, psychology didn't have theories about how the mind works.

00;06;35;27 - 00;07;01;00
Joscha Bach
Surprisingly, it was not trying to develop any and why artificial intelligence was mostly concerned with how to make data processing more efficient. There was this tradition in artificial intelligence right from the start that saw it as a philosophical project, as a practical project that we could implement our theories. And it's also a very difficult project, one that you cannot make solve.

00;07;01;00 - 00;07;27;26
Joscha Bach
Two main questions Within the three years scope of grant proposal. It's disincentivized most of people in the AI to work on this question and also got the discipline mostly to not be concerned about it. But what I liked about computer science is the criteria for what's valid, because I discovered that you can publish and work in computer science regardless of your age or the school that you're in, because the criteria for what's valid are not social criteria.

00;07;28;08 - 00;08;02;00
Joscha Bach
Your program either works or it doesn't. And that's quite beautiful because in philosophy it's not the same thing. In philosophy, something is valid as long as people are willing to listen to you. So it's mostly social criteria at some level that determine why this theory gets popular or not. And I found that philosophy has become almost sterile and unproductive in the last century, and most of the progress this in philosophy has been made outside of the field in computer science, for instance, in mathematics and some areas of foundational physics.

00;08;02;02 - 00;08;05;01
Joscha Bach
So that's how I put my start. Yes.

00;08;05;27 - 00;08;29;08
Speaker 1
So my question is, you mentioned philosophy is almost become sterile. Then you felt like there was growth in artificial intelligence production. Now how have you specially because with your work, you work with consciousness and then assimilation and then somehow that is our understanding of the world and like how we are, who we are. Where is that overlap?

00;08;30;19 - 00;08;58;10
Joscha Bach
So I ask the question, what, what? RB What is, how is it possible that we can experience anything? And that was in some sense the first question that puzzled me. I thought, it's possible to understand how reasoning works, how language works, how knowledge works, how you reaction to patterns works in such a way that you make data compression models of why these patterns and connect this with a sympathetic motivational system and so on.

00;08;58;23 - 00;09;30;10
Joscha Bach
But feeling that seemed to be very mysterious to me. How is it possible that the machine feels anything? So the first question I asked myself was What is an emotion? And how are emotions represented? And the first answer that I found that I found convincing was by a German psychologist, Dietrich Donner and Dietrich. Donner had the insight that emotion is the configuration of cognition was not the way in which you expressed it, but this is what it came down to.

00;09;31;00 - 00;09;52;24
Joscha Bach
Emotion is the way in which cognition works. It's not a parameter inside of the cognitive system that says you are No. 50 angry and no, you are angry, but rather it's a particular way in which you relate to the world. There are basically underlying modulators and these modulators optimize the cognition for the situation at hand, and these modulators direct the way in which your attention works.

00;09;52;24 - 00;10;14;09
Joscha Bach
So it might go narrow or wider, it might go on to certain things more than on other things. It shifts your behavior tendencies one way or the other, and it shifts your experience of valence, of whether some things are good or bad in certain dimensions. And these parameters together, they create a space and being in a certain region of the space, that's what you call emotion.

00;10;14;10 - 00;10;51;21
Joscha Bach
So it's basically our classification of and space, of modulations, of cognition, of what's important inside. To me, it did not explain consciousness or anything, but it explained something about the nature of feelings as assessments of the world by a perceptual system that would be visible to a reflexive system and at another level, the question is how is it possible that something feels like something, a question that is stumping philosophers, how it's possible that physical things feel something and the answer that I gradually stumbled upon and by no means the first person that did this.

00;10;51;21 - 00;11;13;28
Joscha Bach
And once I had this answer, I noticed that much of human cultures and societies had already found that answer. And it was only obfuscated in my own culture is that we live in a dream. Our own perception is a dream perception be entranced by a notion of being in a reality that can only play out in a dream.

00;11;14;14 - 00;11;41;10
Joscha Bach
Physical systems cannot be conscious, only simulations can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property. It's as if it saw in your instant know what it is like to feel anything. But it would be very useful for your organism, for your brain to know what it would be like to be a person that is embedded in a real world, that cares about things in that world and reacts to those things that are happening to it.

00;11;41;27 - 00;12;05;04
Joscha Bach
And so in order to figure that out, it creates a simulation of such a thing apart. It's only a simulacrum, but this thing is basically a simulated person in a simulated model of the world. And the mind is maintaining that the mind is basically an AI that runs on your brain, that creates a virtual world, like a game engine, that is the world that you perceive and interact with, that integrates your sensory experiences.

00;12;05;17 - 00;12;18;25
Joscha Bach
And inside of this world lives a simulated person that integrates your motivation, emotion, reflection, reasoning, attention and model of those. And you identify this that person is this virtual being in this virtual world.

00;12;19;22 - 00;12;31;14
Speaker 1
So who is that voice? And so, like our body, maybe I'm wrong. And what I'm understanding is a simulation by our brain to be able to perceive the the systems around us.

00;12;32;16 - 00;12;55;19
Joscha Bach
And but to perceive the systems around you, you don't need to be a person, right? You just need to open your eyes and try to predict what's going to happen next. And our brain is trying to look at the patterns on our retinas and then try to find relationships through the patterns that appear on the retina to other pictures on the retina at different times, at different positions in the retina.

00;12;56;01 - 00;13;17;22
Joscha Bach
And the functions that your brain discovers are playing out in the three dimensional space, because that's the most efficient encoding that you find over those patterns. And what you then find is that there seem to be solid and liquid objects that are moving around in this space, and these objects correspond to control systems. And some of these control systems are agents that have goals of their own that might be similar to you.

00;13;18;04 - 00;13;41;01
Joscha Bach
So you built this hierarchy of interpretation that allows you to interact productively with the world. But at some point your mind discovers that the purpose of that modeling is regulation of the interaction with the world. And there is an agent that you are part of that is interacting this, that world, and you start modeling that agent, you start to tell the story of the organism that you are and yourself.

00;13;41;01 - 00;13;47;29
Joscha Bach
It's the story about that organism that interacts with the world that you are part of, and your attentional model is generated by and for.

00;13;49;05 - 00;14;03;25
Speaker 1
How is this connected to A.I.? So I know that understanding the human system helps you create artificial intelligence and smarter systems to build in that manner because you can replicate that? Or is that not the case?

00;14;05;01 - 00;14;38;22
Joscha Bach
Artificial intelligence was not started because people wanted to have academic grants or implement machine learning more efficiently. But the reason why we did it was because people wanted to understand how minds work and they discovered the computer is a powerful new tool that can implement arbitrary causal structure, which means if you implement a theory as a set of causal interactions and you go all the way down to first principles, you can translate this and express this as a computer program and then simulate your theory.

00;14;39;08 - 00;15;09;25
Joscha Bach
And this means if you understand all the course, the structure that gives rise to what we call a mind, you should be able to express it as a computer program in this way. Test your theory and make incremental progress until your theory matches the observable and you have an explanation of for what minds are. And this attempt to understand minds has always been one of the driving impulses of artificial intelligence, but it's not been the most valuable part from an economic or academic perspective because it didn't work great.

00;15;09;25 - 00;15;27;28
Joscha Bach
It's something that takes longer than a single researcher, a generation to get to work. And when you are working on a practical problem, you want to have results much earlier and so this philosophical project of AI was only ever going to be something that interested a very small fraction of people working in the field.

00;15;29;00 - 00;15;49;19
Speaker 1
I just have a question related to that. So we don't completely understand how the mind works, even though one. And then second of all, we are creating systems that are self-learning. So is that replicating somehow the way the mind works, or is it deviating from the path?

00;15;49;19 - 00;16;22;15
Joscha Bach
That depends on how we define what a mind is or what is the particular phenomenon that we want to explain? We want to explain how a physical system can have agency. That is something that is not that hard to understand, right? You built a system that is a controller that for you already understood in cybernetics. A controller has some kind of sensor that measures deviation from the way in which things should be, and then it has an actual letter that can direct the way things are towards or away from how things should be.

00;16;22;28 - 00;16;44;03
Joscha Bach
And you measure that difference and you make sure that your actuator is moving at the right moment so you can have heating, for instance, that heats up a room. If the temperature drops too low and turns off the heating, if the temperature goes too high, and then this way you can have this single simple controller and you can introduce more dimensions of control and you can also nest controllers.

00;16;44;03 - 00;17;14;21
Joscha Bach
So you have something that controls the controller, for instance, the sensitivity to a sensor. And once you get the system to make a model of its environment so you don't measure just the temperature right now, but you try to make a model of how the temperature is going to be in the future. If you perform the following actions, then you're heating can become much more efficient because you can now anticipate how long it will take for the temperature in the room to change after you turn off the heating and so on, and how early you can turn it off again based on the way in which the temperature moves.

00;17;15;00 - 00;17;41;04
Joscha Bach
And maybe you can even figure out by seeing how fast the temperature in the room raises, whether the window is open or not. And thereby it will more fine grained control. You can get much more efficient. And so as soon as you connect your controller, it's a model of the future. You get an agent because you have now a system that can model different trajectories of how events play out in the future.

00;17;41;10 - 00;18;05;12
Joscha Bach
And these trajectories are branching based on your own decisions and that means that if you will integrate the reward with those different trajectories, if you make a choice based on that, you know, have desires, beliefs, that's your model and intentions, which are the path that you have committed yourself to by making certain decisions at some point. And so it's a very natural progression from a simple control system into a system that is an agent.

00;18;06;04 - 00;18;24;20
Joscha Bach
You need to have a motivational system, something that cares about how things in the world should be. You need a general modeling system, which means a computer that can create its own causal model irrespective of what's happening around it. So it can model counterfactual about a future world, for instance, or can evoke its own memories and so on.

00;18;25;05 - 00;18;43;15
Joscha Bach
And now the question is how can we build a system that is capable of general learning? What is the right algorithm to build a learning system and a menu base in which you can build a learning system? The simplest one is that you can just try to move off the right set of functions that you want to have to predict the future.

00;18;43;15 - 00;19;04;14
Joscha Bach
But evolution is a very slow, undirected search in all directions. You just randomly change the elements of your function and hope that the resulting functions are more useful than the previous ones, and you find out by testing them all and then selecting those that are best. And then you change those in a bit until you get to the way you want them to be.

00;19;04;14 - 00;19;37;21
Joscha Bach
And it's a very slow process that if the problem that you're learning is too complicated often doesn't converge, which means you're never going to get to a useful result in the reasonable amount of time. And the most powerful algorithm that people have discovered to date in order to learn is called stochastic gradient descent. And stochastic gradient descent works by, first of all, representing the problem in a mathematical form that is quite general, and the mathematical form that people are using is called a neural network.

00;19;37;28 - 00;19;57;12
Joscha Bach
A neural network is often compared to a biological neurons and said to be inspired by them, but they don't actually seem to be understanding about because humans are working. If you compare the two, basically there's a superficial similarity to a toy model of biological neurons, and that the reason that it works like a biological unit might be almost accidental.

00;19;58;10 - 00;20;24;17
Joscha Bach
Basically a neural network is a mathematical model that consists of weighted sums of real numbers that are arranged in chips. They have these every layer is made of lots of samples of the previous. There are some of the different numbers that come from the previous layer, and you give weights to them, which means you multiply each of these factors that each of these segments that go into the sum.

00;20;24;29 - 00;20;50;09
Joscha Bach
And by changing these weights, by changing the factors by which you multiply the value from the previous layer can change the outcome of the function. You also introduce so-called nonlinear cavities, which are basically a fancy way of saying that sometimes you don't have continuous changes, but you have extended changes in the network. So you find the simple way to introduce that change is that you say if the value is below zero, we just set it to zero.

00;20;50;09 - 00;21;14;15
Joscha Bach
And these nonlinear narratives allow this model to also express if then relationships. And it looks like a very clumsy bait where if you switch representative in thinking about as a weighted sums of real numbers that are chained behind each other, but it turns out that the benefit of doing so is that we can introduce gradual changes to the model.

00;21;14;16 - 00;21;40;08
Joscha Bach
These gradual changes working by changing this dissipates until the result becomes more similar to what you want to express. And stochastic gradient descent is the way to figure out how to change these weights in very small incremental steps to get the results gradually slow closer to the fence that we want to have. So imagine you have a function that tries to express whether a photograph depicts a cat or a dog.

00;21;40;18 - 00;22;16;07
Joscha Bach
It's obviously a very complicated function and first of all, works by disassembling the input into a form that the body can understand, which meets numbers before you can take all the pixels and translate each pixel into three color values. Each of them is a number, and then you arrange them based on the position in space, and then you fit this 2D map, see this into the network, and then you take a few hundred of these layers and then each layer you take of maybe millions of these units and you make a very dense connection across the layers.

00;22;16;21 - 00;22;39;19
Joscha Bach
And then the outcome you have maybe two outputs, and one is it's a cat and it's a dog. The third one could be we don't know what it is or it's something it made and now we feed it in millions of pictures of cats and dogs and statistics over them. And whenever the result is not correct, you have an error in the system.

00;22;39;19 - 00;23;05;26
Joscha Bach
And for that we basically look backwards through the network and see how much every of the connections contributed to the error and then we shift every of these connections that contributed to the averages bit in the right direction. This looks like it's a very expensive and slow procedure and indeed it is, but it can run in parallel. They have many, many pictures that feed in and then in 2017, a group of people had an idea.

00;23;05;26 - 00;23;27;27
Joscha Bach
They set instead of doing statistics of everything that happens in the previous layer of the network, let's have a second neural network in every layer that learns what to pay attention to, which part of the statistics they actually need. And it's what it's called this approach. It's called the transformer. It turns out that the transformer is a much more efficient way to train neural networks.

00;23;28;03 - 00;23;55;20
Joscha Bach
And so we could train your networks on things that we couldn't train them before. And also, what happened in the meantime was the computers got larger and cheaper so people could use very large data centers to go through very large amounts of data. And when I myself started to work on things like this in the nineties was in a lab in New Zealand and I tried to find grammar in an unknown language in an unsupervised approach.

00;23;56;01 - 00;24;20;21
Joscha Bach
And the unknown language that I was using was English because it was unknown to the computer and it was very easy to get a large set of English documents for me. And I got the largest computer that you had at the department which had two gigabytes of RAM, and I use it as efficiently as I could, so I did in memory compression with programs that were written in pretty low level C and try to do statistics of the language.

00;24;20;21 - 00;24;52;18
Joscha Bach
And indeed I discovered grammatical structure. And what I noticed is that the closer I was discovering the structure, because they're looking at data compression principles, how well different words were able to predict other words across sentences. I was also able to get closer to the semantic structure of the text, and I thought if I could do much better statistics, I would find more and more of the semantic structure and this would enable me to build models that would be able to construct sentences in very much the same way as it was constructed in the original text.

00;24;53;14 - 00;25;15;22
Joscha Bach
But I only worked on this for about a year, and then I abandoned the area almost completely and only looked at it back then. We came out and talked. Attributed to was the first time I really noticed these models in more detail and I realized that they found a way to make this more efficient by finding efficient ways to do the statistics.

00;25;16;17 - 00;25;47;21
Joscha Bach
And this was actually what this transformer was all about. And now we have a way that learns structure and language by predicting the next words and then encoding the difference training based on that difference in violation of the prediction of the next word. And this idea was formulated in a sense by a called Friston that you learn by predictive coding, that if you try to predict how things are going to play out and whenever something doesn't play out, the baby predicted, you change our model.

00;25;48;27 - 00;26;15;09
Joscha Bach
But I think we can also see that it is free and similar transformer models don't learn in the same way as human beings do. They know it much slower, but they're also able to integrate over more data. They discover first a stylistic structure and things like grammar and text, and then the last thing that is covered semantics. And for us it's the other way about the first in some way learning semantics, what the thing means.

00;26;15;09 - 00;26;33;27
Joscha Bach
And then we learn more niceties like style and syntax. And so we basically have a motivational system that determines relevance for what we interact with, and we have a magnetic system that controls the behavior of a baby before it has a very subsisted coded perceptual model of the world.

00;26;34;28 - 00;26;43;29
Speaker 1
Is that the limit of GPT three and like it. So it's that hurdle that once it crosses that it would be different.

00;26;43;29 - 00;27;02;28
Joscha Bach
The interesting thing is that you don't know what the limit of triplets for is. What we find is that. But. Tippett And Djibouti two had different amounts of data in the model and different size of the model. Basically couple orders of magnitude more data and model size and training. And as a result, it got better by a certain factor.

00;27;03;20 - 00;27;34;29
Joscha Bach
And from typically two or 2 to 3, the same thing happened again. So, again, well, magnitudes of training data in model size and in linear increase in the performance of the model. There's not an obvious. And so basically the more data we seem to be putting into these models, the more we train, the better they get. And as a result, you get a model that is this virtue, because in many ways it's superhuman, because can use Jupiter's three to have an interview between Hannah and Albert Einstein.

00;27;35;27 - 00;28;02;11
Joscha Bach
And to somebody who was not an expert on Hannah Arendt and Albert Einstein, this thing is much better than what the person could have written themselves, and it's able to do this across all domains. There was text in the data. So this is really, really amazing because it can now generate so many categories more than any human being can do, but it's worse than an expert in any of those areas would be because it does not actually have a grounding of what it's talking about.

00;28;02;11 - 00;28;16;26
Joscha Bach
It's just congratulating an event and then it makes errors. It's not learning anything from these errors, it's not updating itself. So of course there are people which work on how to make versions of this that can update themselves and integrate back into this and they get better.

00;28;18;02 - 00;28;33;20
Speaker 1
Isn't the issue with the EIA like this, which has like, you know, it's it has a memory thing where it's like within this space of time and it captures that information, but it's not able to go back and forth like, you know, when we can switch between dust.

00;28;33;20 - 00;28;56;08
Joscha Bach
Yes. So we have an attention to know that it's our working memory in which we construct a model of the reality as it is right now and be constantly at this attention window know that we have on the world. Which means, as I read the book and I read the last chapter, I might recall parts of the first chapter and instances them in my mind and revise for that doing from the first chapter based on that.

00;28;56;19 - 00;29;18;16
Joscha Bach
Or it might even physically get up to my bookshelf and take out this book or another book that I read. The different time and compare with our right there. And we integrate this information in the way and gets frequently train these models. They cannot really recall the original training data and go back to what they learned, but they mostly interact with the structures that they've built over this.

00;29;19;12 - 00;29;49;20
Joscha Bach
But not it's not clear that this is a fundamental limitation or even if you don't revise the algorithm, if you cannot just force it. So at the moment, it's very difficult for GTC to make a summary of the book in the same way as we do, because it's attention to data is just moving through the data and not often, not even in a linear fashion, because it might learn the book by splitting it up into different portions of text that are then fed multiple times into the algorithm and correlated statistically.

00;29;50;26 - 00;30;09;11
Joscha Bach
I suspect that the main reason why do it is we is able to do a summarization of books is because it also has many, many summaries of the books that it looked at in the training data because it's trained the substantial fraction of the Internet. So it's in many ways forcing things that people do with more intelligence.

00;30;10;02 - 00;30;24;26
Speaker 1
So how is daily? I'm not sure if you know, daily is like when it interprets text into images. So how is this different from DVD three and how does this change paradigm of AI?

00;30;24;26 - 00;30;43;17
Joscha Bach
What we find is that GPT three is only at the lowest level interacting with words, and these words are not sequences of characters, but they are positions in a vector space that they are already mapped into. And in this sector of space they are organized according to the similarity between the words and statistics that we find over the text.

00;30;43;25 - 00;31;12;03
Joscha Bach
That's because people who built Jupiters we saw if the preprocessor detects in this way, it's going to be more easy for the system to learn structure in it. And after the first few layers, it goes even beyond that and basically maps this all into a conceptual space. And the operation to keep it is playing out in this conceptual space and then mapped back into tokens that are can be expressed as words and letters and displayed on the screen in a way that we understand.

00;31;12;16 - 00;31;37;26
Joscha Bach
And it turns out that this space of meanings that Jupiter's v discovers has a structure that can be matched to the space of meaning that a transformer that is trained on images discovers. And it's tempting to think that a similar thing happens in our own mind. That is the similar structure for the space of meanings that we discovered behind language to the space of things that you can touch in the space and things that you can see.

00;31;39;02 - 00;31;58;22
Joscha Bach
And it turns out that there are basically two spaces that we discover in this space. One is the world that we touch. It's decoupled, extends out the extended world, the world of things, of stuff in space. Everything in this world can be mapped to surfaces and volumes in a three dimensional space, in the same three dimensional space that is connected.

00;31;58;25 - 00;32;32;03
Joscha Bach
So this is the world that we interact with and everything else is the world of ideas. And this world of things needs to be fully coherent in the sense that we expect that it's playing out in a definite way. Quantum mechanics complicates this a little bit, but by and large, the world that we interact with consists of stuff in space spaces flat, and this stuff is made of liquids, solids and gases and occupies that space in a coherent, consistent manner.

00;32;32;03 - 00;32;40;20
Joscha Bach
And everything else is ideas. And the ideas don't need to be fully coherent. But the ideas explain what is happening in that physical space.

00;32;41;10 - 00;32;53;25
Speaker 1
So. So you mentioned in the past that the current methods of machine learning is flawed and they seem to choose to go again. You do seem to choose to go against the grain. What exactly does that mean? What's so different about your approach?

00;32;55;09 - 00;33;32;09
Joscha Bach
I don't think that that is my approach and the approach of machine learning. I think that they're learning for the most part, tries to answer a different question then the questions that people like me are trying to solve. But there is a substantial overlap. Machine learning is about making statistics more efficient and traditionally these statistics come out of a subfield of applied mathematics, and the models that exist have properties that have been proven to be correct, but the models have been often very simple, which means there is only a certain degree of statistical analysis that was possible.

00;33;33;00 - 00;33;56;27
Joscha Bach
And machine learning in many ways is experimental statistics. You just try to find out of unprincipled base and how to make statistical predictions over how things are. And you evaluate these models at first empirically, which means you test. But the one machine learning algorithm gets better results than another one without having a deep mathematical understanding of why that is the case.

00;33;58;02 - 00;34;17;07
Joscha Bach
And often you also don't design the machine learning algorithm based on a mathematical theory of what's going to work better. But you just experiment and you follow your experimental intuitions, and then you make a mathematical model that tries to show why something is better than another thing or why something works at all. And that's, for instance, true for the transformer.

00;34;17;07 - 00;34;45;05
Joscha Bach
There's still a lot of debates about why the transformer works so well as it does, and are there better ways to abstract the transformer. And so if you look at the current transformer models of vision we have, it's in stable diffusion. Stable diffusion is a model that is generated by trust of learning over images. And these images are organized and highly compressed embedding space that is represented at the rates of a neural network.

00;34;45;16 - 00;35;17;19
Joscha Bach
And then you have so-called samplers that take a given phrase, a prompt, and then establish the similarity between the meaning of that prompt to animate and use this to guide the generation of an image by this model using the so-called sampler, The sampler is some mathematical algorithm that tries to figure out how to move the output of this model of stable diffusion toward something that is more to the description of the image that you want until it ends and local optimum.

00;35;18;21 - 00;35;43;00
Joscha Bach
And at the moment, this process is relatively slow in the sense of on my end, one MacBook, it takes a half a minute to convert to a result and then of five stipulated a data center. This goes down to a few seconds, but then some kids that have designed or discovered algorithms that are not in the public domain yet that are orders of magnitude faster.

00;35;43;00 - 00;36;19;02
Joscha Bach
So there are ways to construct samplers that would use the same model input, the same regularities that have been found to converge in real time to the output and analysis new applications. So now we can probably use these diffusion models for vision. You can use image guided diffusion instead of using a text. This input uses images as input and tries to create an image that is similar to the input image and the nice property is that in order to do that, it needs to create an embedding space that is basically a space of meanings as corresponds to the content of that image.

00;36;19;23 - 00;36;45;02
Joscha Bach
And if it could directly reach out and interpret the contents of that embedding space, it would be similar to having a mental state that represents that world, that you could use it as a perception module. And I suspect this is going to be the major application of these models in the near future. But when you've got such a model that uses image based guidance to converge toward the state of what you see in the camera image, and this thing contains the perception model of reality around it.

00;36;46;03 - 00;36;53;29
Joscha Bach
And if we can connect this versus reflection, reasoning and knowledge, we enable a large set of new, very valuable AI applications.

00;36;55;07 - 00;37;02;28
Speaker 1
So what would differentiate these applications from a human being? Because it's almost replicating the same behaviors.

00;37;04;11 - 00;37;32;19
Joscha Bach
It is replicating some of the behaviors, but it's slightly different. It's in many ways with forcing the behavior of a human being. If you look at how stable diffusion was trained, it takes several hundreds of millions of images that have no relationship between adjacent images, and you connect them with captions of these images. You associate them this description of the images, and you train the model by giving it.

00;37;32;23 - 00;37;51;11
Joscha Bach
The correct caption was the image and sometimes the wrong captions. The image are very often the wrong captured this, the image and only certain statistics over until the model converges. That requires dramatic large amount of training. There's many things that for the model don't work right, and it only works because you have so much compute that you can throw at it.

00;37;51;29 - 00;38;14;29
Joscha Bach
And the model has such good memory that it's able to integrate over so many disparate bits, bits of data, piece by piece until gradually start to make sense. And I don't think that a human brain would be able to integrate over so many images that are disconnected instead, what we do is we focus on very small regularities that we can discover and very little data that only changes gradually.

00;38;14;29 - 00;38;39;27
Joscha Bach
Either every frame is connected to the previous frame and very similar to the previous frame and only changes in very particular but important rate. And we gradually build up models. But what are the first principle components of the changes in which we are seeing? For instance, the neighborhood between sensory neurons on our skin or retina, and then we see objects moving over our skin or moving over our retina as connected blobs.

00;38;40;11 - 00;39;03;06
Joscha Bach
And then we try to understand the shape of these blobs. Then we move our eyes are going to move our skin and how they remain static in space. And then we notice how they move through space and we notice the dimensionality of the space and the shape and properties of the object in that space. And then we notice how they are being accumulated, how the geometry of movement works, how the skeletons of objects look like joints in the trees.

00;39;03;06 - 00;39;24;18
Joscha Bach
Can they change? And then we see the what's the forces behind those movements? Why are the objects moving in this space? Is this inertia or is there some control system behind it? And what is directing this control system? And eventually, you know, some of them are agents that have goals that can only be explained by preferences but built into these objects that direct it into the future.

00;39;24;27 - 00;39;32;03
Joscha Bach
And then we discover ourselves and the interaction with these other objects and we try to account for who we are and how that influences the world.

00;39;33;04 - 00;39;40;18
Speaker 1
Oh, you posted a video on some thoughts into the object about us living in a simulation. What are your current thoughts on this?

00;39;42;00 - 00;40;09;20
Joscha Bach
So I don't think that we live in a simulation in the sense that there is an inert in a higher dimension that has a computer that simulates this universe similar to Minecraft. It seems to me that when we look at fundamental that the universe that we are in is not a Turing machine in the deterministic sense, but a non-legislative machine, which means it's branching into the multiverse.

00;40;10;10 - 00;40;40;16
Joscha Bach
Multiverses are extremely inefficient to implement on a normal computer. So if you were to live in this simulation, I suspect that that would not be quantum mechanics. It seems that quantum mechanics is the expected outcome if you were in basic reality. So in this sense, I think that the physical universe that we are in is most likely the fundamental level of reality, and quantum mechanics emerges over that fundamental level and the particle universe emerges for quantum mechanics in spacetime over the particle universe.

00;40;40;22 - 00;41;05;00
Joscha Bach
These basically all levels of abstraction of modeling that our mind learns to impose on reality, to understand how simpler questionnaires lead to the course of structure that we can observe at a certain course, creating a simplification that is more congruent with what our senses can resolve and our mind can model. And so in this sense, we don't live in a simulation.

00;41;05;00 - 00;41;30;03
Joscha Bach
Most likely, I think, though, we cannot completely rule that out. But what you and me experience is not the physical world that we don't experience quantum mechanics, we don't experience photons, electrons and atoms, but we experience as people and emotions and attention and things that we care about and saw and lights and sounds and pattern sounds. So it exists in physics to exist in, to our mind.

00;41;31;07 - 00;41;51;14
Joscha Bach
So in this sense, we live in a simulation, we live in a simulation that is generated by our own brains. And what you see is a universe that is generated in your visual cortex and your motor cortex, the auditory cortex, and integrated throughout the brain into game board, game engine. And in this game engine, you will perceive objects around you.

00;41;52;18 - 00;42;15;15
Speaker 1
Yeah. You wrote about going from A.I. to artificial consciousness. Even though we programed robots and built into them limited. Yeah. Capabilities. I think if consciousness is far fetched, what are your thoughts and thoughts about it? What are your what are the challenges and how can we build an AI consciousness if we cannot go or get a good explanation of human consciousness?

00;42;15;15 - 00;42;18;09
Speaker 1
At the very least, if my understanding is correct.

00;42;19;28 - 00;42;47;18
Joscha Bach
I suspect that there are many people which have a good explanation of what human consciousness is, but they're not well integrated with the discourse in AI, in your science and philosophy. And that might be because of the different intellectual traditions and the concepts that they use and the language that they're using, the ontology that the metaphysics by which they try to describe the world, people who are good at understanding consciousness tend to be people who do a lot of introspection.

00;42;47;18 - 00;43;13;08
Joscha Bach
By meditation, they might be Buddhist meditators and so on. And the language that they're using cannot be translated into the language that neuroscientists are using. Instead, we see people think that they understand what the other one is saying, but they're doing this based on the preconceptions that they already have, which almost invariably leads to some mistranslation, because sometimes you need to forget what you think the concepts are.

00;43;13;08 - 00;43;37;29
Joscha Bach
You need to learn your concepts from scratch. And part of what I'm trying to do is to get this translation to work. For instance, in our own culture that exists, the word spirits. Spirits are an old concept that existed before the Enlightenment. And with the Enlightenment we have eliminated this concept of spirits as a superstition. Spirits don't exist, right?

00;43;37;29 - 00;44;15;19
Joscha Bach
Every reasonable person believes that spirits are not real because they have been described as disembodied, right? And everything that exists must have a body. But what we notice is that people have minds and they want to do things. And how can they do this? There's some coherence happening, some pattern in the patterns of the cells and I think that spirit is the old word for it type of software for a type of agent that emerges over the controlled structure of a bunch of cells, for instance, that interact with each other in a coherent manner.

00;44;16;10 - 00;44;40;02
Joscha Bach
Or you could say that a spirit is an operating system for an autonomous robot, and we are autonomous robots made from many cells. And each of these cells in turn is also a very simple autonomous robot, that single celled animal. And they live together in a state building organism, a human being. And this state made from many, many cells and they are the state is organized in a coherent manner.

00;44;40;20 - 00;45;07;24
Joscha Bach
And this coherent manner is an agent that play. It's not physically real. It's only a pattern that we see in the interaction of the many cells that allows us to model them and use that model to direct TPV off the cell. Expanding our own brain is making that model, and this is what the spirit is. I think it's an autonomous regulation system for for this shambling mound of cells that is an agent.

00;45;07;24 - 00;45;31;26
Joscha Bach
And when the spirit was invented, the only autonomous robots that were known but were not made for machines, they were all biological or made over the interaction of biological things. So the only agents that were known to people in plants and animals and nation states and cities and so on. And so we can say that to some degree of abstraction that nation states have a spirit.

00;45;31;26 - 00;45;59;09
Joscha Bach
And there it is embodied by the institutions that do the cognition for that nation state and its decision making. And that is a very distributed thing. It's concentrated in its institutions of government and academia, but it's also reaching into every individual that is contributing to the discourse of that system. And it's only coherent to some degree. And in some ways that's also true for our own mind in which it works.

00;45;59;22 - 00;46;29;15
Joscha Bach
So I think that this notion of a spirit is a pretty good metaphor. Now, if you have a system that has a reflexive attention, attention is the ability to focus on something in the in which a conductor focuses on the music that is being played by the orchestra, by individual instruments to the world. The conductor is to make the performance of the orchestra coherent, to make sure that everybody is playing the same piece of music and everybody is contributing to this piece of music in the right way.

00;46;29;15 - 00;46;53;09
Joscha Bach
So it becomes as coherent and harmonious as possible. And once you have such a conductor, whether it's the government of a nation state or the consciousness in a human being, you have the possibility that the system becomes more coherent and it could become in a completely decentralized fashion. Only it so it's an emergent but social structure implemented from the same components as everything else.

00;46;53;27 - 00;47;17;04
Joscha Bach
The conductor, in your mind is not fundamentally different from the individual instruments that play the music of the mind and also the conductor. An orchestra is not different in its substance from the people who play the individual instruments, right? It's just one instrument in a way. And this conductor in our own mind needs to be reflexive because every single moment to self-organizing.

00;47;17;29 - 00;47;35;23
Joscha Bach
So the structure needs to stabilize itself. And the way in which you stabilize yourself as the conductor is that you make sure that you are the conductor and not something else or spacing out and lose your own structure. So of all attention flips back and forth between the content that we attend to and the fact that we are attending to it.

00;47;36;22 - 00;48;05;07
Joscha Bach
And so we don't just model the things that pieces are out perceptually when we pay attention to them, but also the way in which we pay attention and the fact that we pay attention. So our attention is directed on content and mode of access and reflection. And these three components are, I think, what constitutes the phenomenology of our own consciousness is the self-reflexive attention in which the attention becomes its own object.

00;48;06;10 - 00;48;11;29
Speaker 1
And what is reality then?

00;48;11;29 - 00;48;42;00
Joscha Bach
It's a term that is used in different forms. Debate. I use this term in order to be real. Something needs to be implemented. So the real things are those things that are being implemented, but things themselves are only real to a certain degree. The universe is real in the sense there is an underlying reality that produces causal structure, and that seems to also be persistent in the way at least that's the best model that you can make of it, that there is some continuity going on.

00;48;43;01 - 00;49;11;04
Joscha Bach
So otherwise we would not be able to model it and insight of that world. We exist as some kind of concept structure and when we try to model, the university cannot do this as a whole. We cannot take in the state vector of the universe and predict how is going to play out. We need to make this manageable, and we do this by slicing the universe into different subsystems that are more tightly coupled then the connections between that you call these different subsystems objects.

00;49;11;20 - 00;49;46;16
Joscha Bach
So if you separate the universe into small step universes, each of those can be described as its own state. And the model, the interaction between these objects and these objects are only real to some degree because the base of the universe goes out of sync with our description of the universe, the separate objects. And because this space in which the universe deviates from this nice description into separate objects, entropy, entropy describes the way in which the universe trends away from our description into things that we can manage and control and interact with.

00;49;46;16 - 00;49;56;14
Joscha Bach
So we have to adjust our model of the universe, or we have to adjust the order of the universe to keep it arranged into those objects, which means we have to constantly resist entropy.

00;49;58;12 - 00;50;16;04
Speaker 1
And then what is the purpose of God if there is no God? What are your beliefs in it? And how does this thing, this existence of a superior power or God work in a simulated reality that we perceive?

00;50;16;04 - 00;50;34;25
Joscha Bach
So the first step that we need to make when we try to understand the true nature of God is that we need to understand epistemology. Everything that we understand is the result of a mental state that is represented. A particular weights or everything that you perceive think, imagine can only be as good as our minds can represent it.

00;50;34;25 - 00;51;01;23
Joscha Bach
And if there is a bulk in the representation of our own mind and what we perceive to be backing what we think will be baggy, what we represent will be key. And that means that we need to understand what it means are represents something at all in mind. What is the relationship of what we represent to reality? And that determines what can be true and is philosophy a field of what it means for something to be true and under which conditions something is knowable is called epistemology.

00;51;02;22 - 00;51;22;15
Joscha Bach
So basically we need to figure out epistemology, We need to figure out the criteria under which something is. And what's gets into the debate is that the majority of people don't have any concept of epistemology, which means you can tell them stuff and they might believe that stuff based on criteria that are completely unrelated to whether that thing is likely true or not.

00;51;24;00 - 00;51;45;16
Joscha Bach
If you incentivize people to believe a certain thing, they might choose to believe it, even if they don't actually have a rational reason to believe that it's true. So for instance, if somebody if you ask somebody why something is true and that person tells you because I've talked to a burning bush or because it came to me in a dream, is this a valid criterion to determine the structure of reality?

00;51;46;04 - 00;52;20;17
Joscha Bach
Normally you would probably say no, but it's very different if that person has enormous amounts of power over you. Right. And once you have a situation, very a few people have enormous amounts of power over you and use this to impose beliefs on others, they can also generate social truth means you see lots of respectable people around you submitting to the same set of beliefs and that for most people it's very, very hard to escape from a belief that is being shared by everybody around them because it separates them from the cultural, intellectual, epistemic universe about them.

00;52;20;17 - 00;52;43;05
Joscha Bach
And they are now forced to form their own notion of reality. And that even happens in academia. But people actually are originally incentivized to go towards truth. Or as soon as academia gets into the grip of ideologies that cut people off from the realm of truth and the human thought space, they drop into this and they will restrain their thinking very often to those parts.

00;52;43;21 - 00;53;08;15
Joscha Bach
So when we try to understand the notion of God, it's important to realize there are many institutions that have propagated the notion of God, often very forcefully. They might punish you if you don't have the right notion of God. But this creates an environment in which it's very difficult to understand what you're actually talking about. I would say that our own self is real to some degree.

00;53;08;16 - 00;53;37;09
Joscha Bach
It's implemented in our own minds, but it's the story about a virtual person and it's the person doesn't actually exist. Our self is only real to some degree. It can be changed. Well, it's as real as the echo in living mountains. It's an event. It's somewhat real, but it's not the underlying class. The structure, the course and structure is the fact that there is wind and that there are mountains and the mountains are changed by the winds, by some degree by the court.

00;53;37;28 - 00;54;03;25
Joscha Bach
But it's the structure itself. It's not clearly visible to us. We only can infer the structure of our own mind by the equal that we are observing and the self. Because you would say that to some degree it is for you, right? It's a software that is implemented as a model in your own mind and but it's only in your own mind and other people have a model of you, but it's not self, it's not a model of their own agency.

00;54;03;25 - 00;54;26;13
Joscha Bach
It's a model of your agency that they have in the mind. But what happens if you have a self that spends multiple minds, not just one? So it's an agent that is able to move between minds and go across modes and get synchronized between them and perform things by running on many people's minds simultaneously. Right? Such a thing can exist.

00;54;26;13 - 00;54;49;20
Joscha Bach
And this is what we call the God with this model and cultures before our monotheist cultures had many of those gods were basically serfs that were forming as archetypes or so narratives or observations of systems of agency like ecosystems and and disturbance and so on. And they got implemented in part on the minds of people, and that had causal power.

00;54;49;20 - 00;55;14;19
Joscha Bach
So the gods were starting to coexist. This sets of people in shaping societies and cultures and the interaction between people and the environment. But this is nothing superstitious about it. The gods are just as real as other others, but you can drown them out in the same way as you can destroy the self of a person by giving them substantial amounts of drug, subjecting them to mental torture.

00;55;14;27 - 00;55;35;25
Joscha Bach
And in this they destroy their stuff, get them in the condition their mind that's no longer house the original self or only a crippled version of it, or completely dissociates and no self is left. You also notice at night when the dream maybe if you don't have a self, you only see what's going on. Or if you have a different self identified as something that is completely alien.

00;55;35;25 - 00;55;58;08
Joscha Bach
It has no similarity to who we think we are during the daytime. So this notion of God, this victim is a total God and it's a God that is the God of all gods, right? It's about mind, so to speak. And as far as I can tell, based on all the sources that are available to me, God was created about 6000 years ago.

00;55;59;06 - 00;56;28;24
Joscha Bach
There are no sources beyond that that speak to the existence of God. And God is incoherent because he's been talked a lot and most of the destroyers are not very good spatially. It's the software. It's an AI that is running on many minds and it is synchronized by a dedicated institutions, religious institutions, and these religious institutions indoctrinate young children systematically to give them the same notion of God and the institutions try to figure out the esthetics of the thought of God.

00;56;28;24 - 00;56;57;19
Joscha Bach
What is the ideal total God that is directing the entire civilization and its interaction with life on Earth? And because so many people are trying to fight this, this thing exists to some degree. It is implemented. And so I would say that God is real, but God is incoherent. I suspect that there are many layers to God and they don't all want the same thing because they're not completely coherent, even though the specification of God says it should be coherent because this is what you want to create it.

00;56;57;20 - 00;57;18;00
Joscha Bach
So God is an agent that emerges over the interaction of many individuals and the relationship of the individual to God is the same as the relationship that cell has to the organism and single celled organisms which don't have a relationship to something larger in the same way, there are people that don't have a relationship to God.

00;57;19;13 - 00;57;36;19
Speaker 1
And then where does psychedelics come into play? Because there's that's another simulation that we experience and there's a lot of literature out there that says that psychedelics kind of initiated religion.

00;57;36;19 - 00;58;03;27
Joscha Bach
I suspect that this is the result of people taking psychedelics. Terence McKenna thought that human language was emerged after people took a lot of mushrooms, and I think that you had this idea, well, it was a mushrooms. And what psychedelics too, is that they changed the neurotransmitter configuration of your mind from into different states. And they introduced basically dreaming state states in which you integrate the same information that you have and your mind in different ways.

00;58;03;27 - 00;58;42;17
Joscha Bach
It's not magic. It just puts you into a state of mind that some people are a natural. It basically force the space of neurotransmitter configurations and the effect is usually one that's outside of the range in which you are conventionally functional. So people that are in psychedelics typically are unfit to make complicated decisions about the future, but they are able to explain lots of things, how they fit together in the past, which means from a machine learning perspective, they're probably overfitting, they create functions that are able to explain all the previous data in the training set, but they are not able to give us the data in a test set with extra reality.

00;58;42;17 - 00;59;08;27
Joscha Bach
People that do a lot of psychedelics turn then don't tend to be much better in getting this to be about later on. It's so it seems to be possible for people on psychedelics have important insights because they are able to deploy what bits for the same function and arrange information in a different way and they basically need to get back to a sober state and able to prove that these things are actually taught because they we've just been dreaming.

00;59;09;05 - 00;59;36;14
Joscha Bach
Psychedelics enable a different way for people to dream of being awake, and so they integrate these dream memories into their real time experience. Things that didn't happen physically happened in their own experience, and now they learn from these things that didn't happen when these dream events. And that's both very powerful and very dangerous because it also means that they act based on training data that don't correspond to anything that actually happened in the world.

00;59;37;00 - 00;59;42;28
Joscha Bach
And that's an important question. Did people discover God because thought didn't exist before people dreamed got?

00;59;43;17 - 00;59;43;25
Speaker 1
Huh?

00;59;44;19 - 01;00;11;07
Joscha Bach
And if I look at the history of religions, it seems to me that people could have gotten this intuition much, much simpler. Basically, we don't just have ourselves that first thing in the world. We notice that, for instance, of relationship that we're serving these relationships. When we have children, we start serving our family. And this family agent is this system of agency that we feel to be part of.

01;00;11;07 - 01;00;32;00
Joscha Bach
That happens also when we have a village or a group of people that interact tightly. And as soon as we formalize this interaction and try to understand what is the spirit of this civilization and how can we serve it, then we're focused. When you discover something like a tribal spirit and this tribal spirit is the tribe of God similar to the Hebrew God.

01;00;32;27 - 01;01;05;07
Joscha Bach
And over a long process of I think the Hebrews were mostly sober when they did this, they discovered ways to flesh this out and to make it more powerful and so on. And by being completely sober, you also notice how techniques by which you can hypnotize people into serving God in particular rewards. And I suspect that's also been an important part of the religion, and that there were basically technologies that are being used to implement ideas on people's minds before they could understand these ideas and thereby direct them into a certain place.

01;01;05;08 - 01;01;12;29
Joscha Bach
I suspect that basically talking to people at a very young age about how reality works is more powerful than giving adults drugs.

01;01;14;15 - 01;01;22;28
Speaker 1
All right. Well, you've said that simulations can be conscious physical systems cannot be conscience. Can you explain that a little bit?

01;01;23;20 - 01;02;01;04
Joscha Bach
Yes. Physical systems as we see them, are mechanical, which means that there is closer interaction between parts that lead to the emergence of other patterns that you can again explain as a structure. But there are representations in physics and it's just these parts moving similar to the distinction between software and hardware. If you look at your computer physically, there is no Minecraft, there is no text processor, it has only electrical states and transistors that lead to switches and the transistors and the software that we look at is becomes only apparent at a certain level.

01;02;01;04 - 01;02;21;08
Joscha Bach
Of course, training we need to take a step back and abstract the course of the structure in a certain way. So we say a regularity and the patterns and this regularity dysfunction that we discover is in different layers of modeling that we can impose on the same system, in the same physical system. In this sense, software is a very specialized physical law.

01;02;21;26 - 01;02;43;23
Joscha Bach
It means events matter in the universe in this particular way. Then they are going to perceive at a certain level this pattern and then that pattern and then that pattern. And this is what physical law is about. It's a certain pattern that you will observe for reasons of mathematics based on the arrangement of patterns at a lower level.

01;02;44;05 - 01;03;02;21
Joscha Bach
You see this pattern emerging at a higher level. And in this sense, the mental states that you're having a software states are representational states that emerged over the interaction of many units, and they allow us to make sense about why the new ones are firing at a certain point and how this relates to the action of the organism.

01;03;03;13 - 01;03;22;04
Joscha Bach
And the mind is discovering itself, these patterns. So the mind is discovering itself to discover its representational states as representational states, to go back to this notion of an agent. If you want to go from the controller, from the thermostat to an agent, a system that cares about its future, it needs to be able to represent the future.

01;03;22;04 - 01;03;43;05
Joscha Bach
And the future is a world that doesn't exist yet. So we need to create a course and structure that is different from the underlying cost structure. And this insulator of the simulated course, the structure of the underlying cost structure is a computer. This is what the computer can do. It can simulate arbitrary cost structure that is the power of the computer.

01;03;43;21 - 01;04;05;29
Joscha Bach
And the simplest computer that we know in nature is the individual cell. This individual cell is able to compute lots and lots of different things using DNA and RNA by manipulating the symbols, amino acids that are written on that tape before backwards and forwards on the tape and performing actions, including changing the state of the tape based on those actions.

01;04;06;03 - 01;04;27;16
Joscha Bach
This is very close to Turing's abstraction of the computer as a Turing machine using a tape and every great head that is changing the symbols on the tape and so cannot learn everything. That is a limitation of this, because it's very difficult for the cell to integrate information over a long time spans and to do something with that information.

01;04;27;28 - 01;04;40;26
Joscha Bach
But arrangements of cells can do that. So at the different level of emergence, you can take many, many simple cells and put them into a more complicated arrangement that can integrate information over larger timescales. And this is what we are doing.

01;04;42;01 - 01;04;52;01
Speaker 1
What is the incentive based scale for human cells, let's say e-systems, because I know that humans, it's like survival, if I'm correct.

01;04;53;19 - 01;05;29;29
Joscha Bach
But individual cells are in some sense driven by an emergent survival in the sense of cells that did not act as if they were motivated by survival, didn't stick around because they had to compete with other cells. Thoughts and of evolution that systems try to persist. But inside of an organism, cells can also sacrifice themselves and they have to be built in such a way that skin cells are able to sacrifice themselves for the greater whole, in the same way as ants can sacrifice themselves for the entail, or human beings can sacrifice themselves for the state and the values.

01;05;30;20 - 01;05;41;28
Speaker 1
So is that the same way I think you've mentioned in the past about rats and then the next generation and how they change over like, you know, based on the environment.

01;05;41;28 - 01;06;08;25
Joscha Bach
And I think what you refer to is that animals can adapt to the environment to not overgrazed it. It's slightly different if you expose rats to scarcity of mice. It turns out that the next generation tends to be more scrawny than the previous one and the reason might be that they have evolved for environments in which you have periods of abundance and periods of scarcity.

01;06;09;14 - 01;06;42;12
Joscha Bach
And if you overgrazed in the periods of SkyCity, you might destroy the underlying food chain, which means that the mice go extinct. So in order to not go extinct and you are confronted with a period of scarcity, you might have to reduce your population and the consumption of your population. So you just stick around and become sustainable and can then can expand again once the period of scarcity ends and you go back into a period of abundance that's not necessarily related to what I was talking to, because that is not an individual decision of the mice to sacrifice themselves mice.

01;06;43;04 - 01;07;18;29
Joscha Bach
But there is maybe a decision for a parent to sacrifice themselves for their children, or there might be a decision for a soldier to sacrifice themselves, for the nation state and or for their friends. And these decisions where an individual organism is willing to sacrifice themselves for something that is more important than them means that the farm agents that are up off the shelf above the ego and be apart of those agents and our notion of God comes out of stating this notion of a group self, of a group identity that generates purposes above the ego.

01;07;18;29 - 01;07;22;05
Joscha Bach
And it's an adaptation to what's being state building.

01;07;22;05 - 01;07;35;09
Speaker 1
How is that different from what you mentioned, the Boss that we've doomed ourselves by like, you know, signing up for Industrial Revolution because now we're doing counter intuitive to what we should be doing based on the model that you just explained.

01;07;36;15 - 01;08;04;03
Joscha Bach
It seems to be very hard to control a state that is industrially organized, centrally top down. We find that dictatorships are very brittle and if you don't have a dictatorship, but some kind of distributed execution of power, it means that we have different incentive structures. So the regulation in the society is distributed. Decision making means that you have lots of local agents that act in a more self-interested manner.

01;08;04;21 - 01;08;29;22
Joscha Bach
And this leads to conflicts because it means that the individual might not have the same or incentives that are compatible with the incentives of the greater good. And this can only be solved by integrating deregulation more top down. So basically you need to be able to get people to behave in ways that are in the interest of the global system, even if it's not in the local interest.

01;08;29;22 - 01;08;49;23
Joscha Bach
But if you, for instance, a parent and you have children, you may not want to sacrifice, expose them to the greater whole. You want to give them the best possible health care, you want to have them to eat well, you want them to live value. You want to insert them as high in the food chain of society as possibly can.

01;08;49;23 - 01;09;13;27
Joscha Bach
Right? And everybody is trying to do that. So when we are confronted with the question of whether we give our children the best possible resources or to create a world in which we can live sustainably for as long as possible by responsible resource use, we might choose our children. Right? And because if you don't do it, somebody else will do it.

01;09;14;14 - 01;09;46;20
Joscha Bach
And take the resources that you don't give to your children. So in this sense, we are doomed to using up as many of our resources as we can. And this means that we get into a situation where we might be extracting more resources from the environment than the environment can reproduce. And At some point we might not be able to find a technological substitute for the food sources that we destroy for the ecosystems that we destroy and dependent on.

01;09;46;20 - 01;10;09;15
Joscha Bach
In the past to feed ourselves so we can create a situation in which the environment is no longer able to sustain our food sources and the climatic conditions of our survival. And this could mean that the large parts of the planet become uninhabitable for humans, and our civilization in its present form collapses.

01;10;10;22 - 01;10;28;23
Speaker 1
How will this and I know, like us as a human form would change, but is there a possibility that we might like, you know, transfer our consciousness into another system and then that system would not require the tools and the environment that we require?

01;10;28;23 - 01;10;49;29
Joscha Bach
I don't see how consciousness would be transferred because your consciousness, for instance, is interrupted when you sleep at night and are in deep sleep and don't dream. It doesn't seem to be a continuity of consciousness. The continuity is only projected to science that you remember something from yesterday and you think you are the same person as yesterday. So you protect this identity.

01;10;50;23 - 01;11;15;13
Joscha Bach
But there is no continuity, right? Your consciousness is recreated again and again and, again. And this means if you cannot even be transferred between yesterday and today, but only recreate it in the shape that similar enough that you can pretend to yourself to the same consciousness as yesterday or the same self as yesterday was only gradual changes. You can also not translate it or transfer it into a machine.

01;11;15;13 - 01;11;24;13
Joscha Bach
You could only create a machine or a system that thinks it's you, but it wouldn't need to see so many properties in the zero beyond that.

01;11;24;13 - 01;11;26;27
Speaker 1
So who is the cells that.

01;11;28;26 - 01;11;31;23
Joscha Bach
Itself is the story that the brain tells itself about the person.

01;11;32;14 - 01;11;35;14
Speaker 1
Second, that story be uploaded or to a system.

01;11;37;17 - 01;12;06;12
Joscha Bach
In principle, yes. So we don't have a technology that just to this year term by your brain uploads. But I think it's conceivable that just by monitoring the output of a person sufficiently about, you can limit the constraints that direct that person in such a way that you create a software that plausibly recreates the personality of that person to people who interact with this creation.

01;12;06;12 - 01;12;28;26
Joscha Bach
And that creation themselves could be organized in such a way that it also thinks that remembers being that person and identifies this being it. But it's entirely virtual, right? It's a software that is that thinks that it is real and that things that extend over time or that things that it's all these other things and it also understand that it's not and it's also true for human beings.

01;12;28;26 - 01;12;46;05
Joscha Bach
We also can get to the state where we realize that our consciousness is not continuous and there's only the now, and that's nothing but now. And there will be a different knows in the future. And at some point there will be not. But it's not a reason for concern. So you can get once you get to the state, you lose your fear of dying.

01;12;47;29 - 01;13;10;05
Joscha Bach
And then once you lose your fear of dying and you look at what's happening, you notice that it's actually not about you. Life. Earth is about the cell, and a cell sometimes organizes into a single celled organisms that form rich ecosystems and sometimes into multicellular organisms. And these sometimes societies of individuals that reflect about having a self and guides for the societies to organize themselves.

01;13;10;22 - 01;13;33;11
Joscha Bach
And then they realize that this is a temporary thing, that things in the universe and earth stick around for a while and then they go extinct and some stuff that stays stable for a very long time stays. Stable because it doesn't need to adapt because it's an environment that doesn't change very much. But humans are something that only has limited adaptation of very specific bodies, insects and so on.

01;13;33;22 - 01;13;51;26
Joscha Bach
And it will be difficult to change this in a fundamental way into a very different species and also a species that is very powerful. We change the environment dramatically and it's not clear if our own existence is compatible. Is the changes that you're going to impose on the planet, but you're not going to be the last intelligent species on this planet, right?

01;13;51;28 - 01;14;00;06
Joscha Bach
At some point you're going to go extinct and it's not clear when that is going to happen. Is this how life is? And at some point there will be new species that take our place.

01;14;01;04 - 01;14;17;10
Speaker 1
You mentioned before that there's a possibility that trees or other things and within our environment are more intelligent than us is just the difference in like the time frame that they are. Their awareness or their they are there. Can you explain a little bit about that?

01;14;18;09 - 01;15;00;15
Joscha Bach
I don't see any evidence that trees are more intelligent than us or even ecosystems, so I'm I don't know that that's possible. I suspect that basically every cell can send chemically encoded messages to the neighboring cells and it can turn to make the sending its interpretation of the message that being sent conditional can evolve to do that, which means that if you have the multicellular organisms that gets old enough and you have subjected to evolution and it benefits from coherent information processing, that every organism in some sense is going to function a little bit like a brain just by the cellular information exchange, but much slower than our brains, because if you just sent messages

01;15;00;15 - 01;15;19;19
Joscha Bach
to your immediately adjacent cells, it's going to take many seconds before the signal is moving more than a few millimeters for the most part. So the organism and so they're the information processing plants is going to be much, much slower compared to our own information process. If they make sense of the world, then at a much slower timescale.

01;15;20;04 - 01;15;45;23
Joscha Bach
And because plants don't get older by the same factor as they're able to integrate information only at a much, much slower rate, which means that they're not going to be as comparatively speaking. So the benefit of humans is they're basically telegraph to us, they send information very critically over long distances and the organism at a very high price, at a very high metabolic rate.

01;15;45;23 - 01;16;08;19
Joscha Bach
They need a lot of energy to be able to do this. So plants are not able to afford this because photosynthesis does not, for the most part, seem to give enough energy to the organism to make this high metabolic rate possible. In order to do this, you need to move around and eat plants that have sort that much energy so you can process that quickly enough to perform this information processing.

01;16;08;19 - 01;16;30;27
Joscha Bach
And the reason why we do that is because we compete with other animals for the same food sources. So we cannot afford to be very slow in farming, the information processing slow. And so our nervous system is an adaptation that happens due to this evolutionary pressure to process information much, much faster and integrate more data into shorter timeframes in a better way.

01;16;30;27 - 01;16;56;27
Joscha Bach
So in this sense, I suspect that plants individually, at least a bit far, not as smart as mammals are. But if plants stick around long enough and integrate information over long timeframes, I suspect that at the ecosystem level there could be considerable levels of control in ecosystems that emerge with the information processing of many integrated, coordinated plants.

01;16;58;01 - 01;17;06;00
Speaker 1
What is the sense in relation to the puzzle of consciousness and how is it related to the simulation our material brain is creating.

01;17;08;29 - 01;17;26;04
Joscha Bach
Itself as a model of our own agency. At its core, it's a model of being an attentional observer. At least that seems to be the minimal self that I can have that I notice that I'm observing, but for the most part, I'm integrated in my everyday life into a personal self, which means I remember that I'm the father.

01;17;26;04 - 01;17;51;00
Joscha Bach
I remember that I'm a researcher. I remember that I'm a human being that has friends that might be hungry or thirsty or tired or awake or elated or depressed, and all these things are a model that allows me to understand of how I am going to interact with the environment from now on and use these interpretations to have thoughts and has stored these thoughts and attentional protocol and use them to direct further behavior and future thoughts.

01;17;51;20 - 01;18;14;23
Joscha Bach
And the same thing happens is my observations of my feelings that are generated below my reflection in my mind as assessments of my alignment to the world that is being simulated in my mind. And basically this is the nature of the self, a model of my own attentional agency over many domains integrated into a story about a person that interacts with the world.

01;18;14;23 - 01;18;26;11
Joscha Bach
And this story is being it's not a story written in words, but it's a multimedia story written in the language of thought that is being used to direct the behavior of this organism in the world.

01;18;26;11 - 01;18;30;23
Speaker 1
What is dualism, materialism and idealism and how they connected.

01;18;32;12 - 01;19;04;27
Joscha Bach
The basically attempts of the philosopher to classify a base in which the world can be metaphysically organized. And in most traditions, idealism is seen as the basic idea that we live in a dream. And that dream is fundamental and also means that magic is possible and so on. And idealism to explain why things in the dream muscle regular and cannot be changed as much as in the dream at night and in the loser dream that you can change everything around you.

01;19;04;27 - 01;19;47;00
Joscha Bach
And then there is materialism, which is the idea that only matter is you, and that we live in the physical world, that it's made of mechanical interactions and everything in that world is the result of the emergence of physical patterns. But materialism has to be explained by something to you. It's like something and you are conscious of how consciousness works and dualism is the idea that there are two worlds that interact with each other physical world and a mental world, and they somehow exchange cluster structure and the original formulation of dualism in the West in addition is understood, for instance, to be Descartes idea.

01;19;47;08 - 01;20;09;28
Joscha Bach
And that idea that you have an extended world extends to the extended stuff. Address the thinking stuff, and they somehow interact with each other. And another thinker thought about this. They saw a problem because the physical world is defined in such way that it's constantly closed. The physical world is exactly other things that interact with the physical world and can be described in physics.

01;20;10;07 - 01;20;38;02
Joscha Bach
And physics works super well and nor obvious gaps in physics where things are happening for reasons that we don't understand. They they happen in ways that might be mathematically complex to grasp, but that doesn't seem to be any spooky ghosts interfering with physics and in ways that mess up our experiments in sudden and unexpected, surprising ways. And so the question is how does the mind interact with the physical world?

01;20;38;02 - 01;21;00;03
Joscha Bach
If the physical world is closely closed and there have been to give us this, for instance, occasionally, isn't that they just happened to be concurrent and drawn in the same vein and God is somehow synchronizing them. And it's, of course, very a talk and awkward and not satisfying. And I suspect that the best way to resolve this conundrum is to realize that.

01;21;00;12 - 01;21;22;29

But first of space is not real. Space Time is an approximation that the mathematical model that we are making over the patterns that you interact with, it's approximately two a certain level of resolution. It doesn't work anymore at very small scales. It may fall apart on the very large scales because that singularities in the space time and it might not work at very high energies.

01;21;23;09 - 01;21;45;24
Joscha Bach
So it happens only for a certain way of abstracting the universe in certain contexts. This notion of space time is basically the set of locations that we can discern in the universe that can hold information and the trajectories along which information can flow using a certain mathematics that models universe. That's a continuous interconnected space, right? And this is only approximately two thirds of space.

01;21;45;24 - 01;22;12;01
Joscha Bach
Time is not completely clear. And this notion of stuff in space that we form is also not even relativistic space time. We don't perceive relativistic effects in our perception. The stuff in space that the observing is generated in the visual cortex, it's an intuitive model that our brain is generating that's pretty coarse and simplified. It just exists to allow us to organize ourselves in the environment at the time scales and spatial that we can perceive and make sense of.

01;22;13;05 - 01;22;23;19
Speaker 1
What does the future look like, though? I mean, how would it involve itself? Like, I know we we could just destroy ourselves, but what's the alternative reality of it?

01;22;24;28 - 01;23;12;05
Joscha Bach
But we can wait until something else kills us, right? We can wait. The next supervolcano erupts and makes agriculture impossible for a few years and your staff or freeze to death or a meteorite hits the earth with a similar result. Or we have a serious pandemic that eradicates enough people to make survival of the rest impossible. Or the our global warming tips the oceans, and we have an eruption of cyanobacteria and the atmosphere becomes unbreathable For us, such things are conceivable and they might happen that if you just wait for long enough, a catastrophic event that is going to eradicate complex life on earth, it's a statistical certainty in the same way as these events

01;23;12;11 - 01;23;32;27
Joscha Bach
happens for statistical reasons every few million years on the planet. And it could also happen that we ourselves are the reason for the things that are happening. And it's not us individually, but the dynamics of our species and the way in which we interact that we cannot completely control and foresee might also be possible that you get outside together and stick it out.

01;23;34;09 - 01;24;00;04
Joscha Bach
But what for? I suspect that the optimal solution for life, not human beings, we are a very particular, very particular ecological niche. We are monkeys that have a long enough childhood to integrate information sufficiently well to form cultures that can understand how widespread that is. Surprising. We are the first species on the planet. I suspect that is able to understand how minds work and build air and even machines that possibly that can sink.

01;24;00;04 - 01;24;07;25
Joscha Bach
And that's going to change the if we succeed in this possibly life on earth in ways that we cannot foresee yet.

01;24;07;25 - 01;24;20;21
Speaker 1
Do you think maybe there's a possibility that there are some out there looking at us like monkeys and watching us evolve and seeing how slow our evolution?

01;24;20;21 - 01;24;42;14
Joscha Bach
Well, if you look at the cell, it seems to be a search algorithm that as the machines have replicator adaptation mechanisms built into it. So if you give the cells long enough and then stable environment, the cell is probably able to evolve intelligence and consciousness. So in this sense, the cell a good probe to send around in the universe to colonize the universe.

01;24;42;25 - 01;25;01;24
Joscha Bach
And I don't think that we are especially slow in this regard to something. It just takes that very long. It takes as long as it takes, and that random affects their role and some environmental effects they are. Well, I don't know if you are particularly sort of I, I don't doubt that the particular though, seems that life arrived on Earth very early on.

01;25;01;24 - 01;25;20;24
Joscha Bach
We don't know whether it arrived by meteor or that in fact it from another planet. This the first yourselves of either the first saw indeed did emerge on our planet. It seems that all life on earth comes from the same cell, the same source that there were not multiple origins of life. At least we don't have any evidence for that.

01;25;22;01 - 01;25;56;24
Joscha Bach
And if aliens exist, it probably requires that our current physics is very incomplete because it might require that there is faster than light transfer of information and physical things in the universe. And we don't have a generally accepted physics that allows for that. But if such things exist, which we don't know, then if a faster than light travel is possible in, the base that doesn't destroy the structure of the thing that is traveling and if it doesn't require exorbitant amount of energy, then it's almost certain that the aliens are here and observing us.

01;25;58;02 - 01;26;33;29
Joscha Bach
But we don't know that as far as I know, and are not able to evaluate the UFO sightings in any productive base ethically. There is this very weird phenomenon that every dozen years or so it's very irregular interval. There are a number of blurry pictures of UFOs and retired Air Force pilots that explained what they saw. So this could all be an up that the governments use to regulate the amount of lithium in the water supply to make sure that their populations don't go to psychotic or who knows what's going on.

01;26;34;05 - 01;26;57;14
Joscha Bach
It's be also it's basically a certain baseline of means and unexplainable phenomena that always are wrong. Or maybe there are indication that something like this exists or it might be new technology that is being discovered and that is not made public and it's only kept under wraps by the military. Who knows? I don't know. So if they transfer a translation, it's possible.

01;26;57;14 - 01;27;22;13
Joscha Bach
Maybe Kevin Kelly's interpretation is correct. Kevin Kelly suggests that faster life travel is possible than the evidence that actually not be visible because they will be traveling outside of the night. But if they want to observe us, they need to put something like a periscope into our space. And what we see the UFO also suggests the end of the periscope, which looks blurry to us that move around very quickly.

01;27;22;21 - 01;27;33;13
Joscha Bach
But the extra space of a probe or whatever it is going to be not visible to us because it needs to move outside of this photonic interactions that we perceive.

01;27;33;13 - 01;27;38;29
Speaker 1
What are you working on recently? What keeps you up at night?

01;27;38;29 - 01;28;20;07
Joscha Bach
First of all, I have children that of direct command, a lot of my attention, and they take away my ability to write books, which I would like to do. I'd like to, I think, write a book on translating and harmonizing these different concepts. For me, I and philosophy of mind, and also from which other traditions and other cultures into a language that you can all understand in which we are able to communicate across the cognitive sciences and philosophy in a productive way and make more sense about who we are and maybe use this to get to a renaissance in psychology and neuroscience that I think we need.

01;28;21;06 - 01;28;41;14
Joscha Bach
And and then yet I'm also interested in all those parts today. I cannot really do how you build a system that is able to learn in real time and update itself continuously that is self-organizing rather than using the brute force of stochastic gradient descent on the neural network architecture with lots of because how can we build something that learns efficiently the data?

01;28;42;00 - 01;29;14;21
Joscha Bach
How can we build something that is entangled with the world and discovers itself and the interaction with the world and can yet states this people? How can we understand people using such systems and change their states and break them up into different states? And I am very fascinated by the current developments and generative artificial intelligence. And even though I think that they put forth what we should be doing with more elegant algorithms, I don't see an obvious limitation to what these systems are doing, so that it's very exciting to see how far we can get this these present approaches.

01;29;15;18 - 01;29;17;27
Speaker 1
How close are we to that reality, though.

01;29;19;15 - 01;29;40;09
Joscha Bach
If you don't know, I don't see good arguments that say to me that that must be one way or the other. Because if you don't know missing, it seems to me that the algorithms that we are using are very different from what the brain is doing, even though some people might disagree with me. But the way which they learned is really based on changed between adjacent frames.

01;29;42;02 - 01;30;03;29
Joscha Bach
Static information is unintelligible to us because it doesn't produce cluster structure in our own mind. All the information that we care about is about change, and the paradigms and mission to ending are mostly focused on static images. So we look for patterns in a static thing and we try to correlate many of these static patterns and then try to understand how we can model change using these static patterns.

01;30;04;27 - 01;30;36;21
Joscha Bach
And maybe this a continuum between those approaches and maybe we can use the other approach to do this. Obviously, we can begin this great effort and so on. Try to use generative AI to produce videos, but it's not very good yet. But maybe there is something that is much more efficient and if we want to get there, it's not clear can we do this by making incremental changes to what we've got or machine learning, or do we need to provide a lot of the algorithms that we are using and start from scratch and don't know this at this point?

01;30;37;07 - 01;30;47;23
Speaker 1
Do you think there would come a time when EAI will develop itself in such a way that it can understand and create a system which will replicate the way we think?

01;30;48;20 - 01;31;08;28
Joscha Bach
I think that's almost unavoidable that we are now building systems that learn how to program right, and we can them to support programing. But as soon as we can get these systems to understand the place that they have and know about the things that they should be doing and search for them and their models of what they should be doing and find strategies to do these things.

01;31;09;22 - 01;31;15;08
Joscha Bach
I don't see how we can get these systems to surpass human performance.

01;31;15;08 - 01;31;26;10
Speaker 1
I think to a certain degree they are like with AlphaGo, you have mentioned that they are performing better than humans and soon they will they will like, you know, take over.

01;31;27;06 - 01;31;34;17
Joscha Bach
Yes, But for a normal human being, it's not clear why they're so based much of their life getting very, very good at cool.

01;31;34;17 - 01;31;34;23
Speaker 1
Hmm.

01;31;35;06 - 01;31;59;10
Joscha Bach
And so for many of the skills that somebody is really, really good at a mental technique, they need to have an impairment, a cognition, while having unimpaired pattern matching abilities. So basically they need to have a form of autism. And the president has ultra autistic right? They can only do pattern matching in their age that's set up, but they don't ask themselves, What am I doing here?

01;32;00;07 - 01;32;19;01
Joscha Bach
And what is the thing that I should be doing instead? Yeah, it's it's not just this motivation itself. It's how to modify your motivation, how to build it up. You start out with hunger and thirst and boredom and exhaustion and, a need for education. But at some point in your life you become an adult and you ask yourself, What is it that I should want?

01;32;19;14 - 01;32;30;01
Joscha Bach
What should give me pleasure and pain? And then you adjust and you'll become more the thing that you need to be under the circumstances that you find yourself to be in.

01;32;30;01 - 01;32;45;17
Speaker 1
Is that what's separating humans from? Is that like, you know, soon enough it will create a system where it will require like, you know, this gives me happiness or this gives me pain. And then based on that, their motivations evolve. And that's what the new system would be.

01;32;46;25 - 01;33;09;09
Joscha Bach
As far as I know, there is no way I in the sense there is no artificial mind that wants something that is able to learn by the interaction with the world in itself and observe itself. And via time, there are only models that do statistics when they're being asked to perform a certain problem. And so they are components and they are crucial components.

01;33;09;09 - 01;33;38;22
Joscha Bach
And we don't know if they have all the components, even though I suspect that you already might. And it's not clear how to make these systems continuous real time self modifying in a flexible enough way. But then again, maybe we can use the present algorithms to do it and build a system that is not human like, but that is sufficiently smart to outperform us in all the relevant areas to build the next generation of any kind of.

01;33;39;02 - 01;33;40;26
Speaker 1
