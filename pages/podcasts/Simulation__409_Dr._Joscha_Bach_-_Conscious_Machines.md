Boom, what's up everyone? Welcome to simulation. I'm your host Don Saki on very excited to be talking about conscious machines. We have Dr. Yoshi Bach joining us on the show. Hello. Hi. Thanks so much for coming on. Really appreciate it. I'm super excited for this episode is gonna be a really good one guys. Dr. Yoshida, Bach is VP of research at AI foundation and author of principles of synthetic intelligence. He's focused on how our minds work, and how to build machines that can perceive, think and learn. And you can find the links below in the bio to bach.ai BAC h.ai, as well as his LinkedIn and Twitter profiles. Alright, y'all. So let's start things off with one of our favorite questions. What are your thoughts on the direction of our world?

Joscha Bach 1:01
I think we are right now. At the top of our world, we are at the best possible position to be born into imagine that you have the choice of being born into a sustainable, sane world that is an agricultural societies 300 million people tops, no internet, no long range, transportation, no interesting educational system, and so on, right? Or you can be in an insane world, a world that has just burned 100 million years words or tweets in a single century to give everybody plumping and access to the world's knowledge is an afterthought to a global chat room to four point distribution, basically the internet, right. And this is the thing that we have right now. It's an insane world, right? It's a world in which we have computers in which we can travel anywhere, we can talk to seven and a half billion people that are often very smart and interesting. And beyond the first time in history on this planet of any life form, I think in a situation that we can mean for the reflect the universe, this is a really amazing time to be alive, it's really the best time to be alive. So in some sense, you could see life on earth is this entropic puddle that is more or less sustainable for a while, I mean, one and a half billion years, then the atmosphere will be gone, and life on earth in its current form will cease to exist. And a few billion years later, the sun will engulf the planet. And I don't think that there will be a meaningful export of life from this planet in an intelligent form. But might be who knows, probably not our species, though, we are the first ones that basically made this very short game, to jump out of this puddle as high as we can. And we are right now I think at the top of this parabola, and from here, of course, it will go down again. So people look down and they freak out. They realize basically the cantilevered ourselves over an entropic Airbus and there is no land on the other side, right can be calm down, it will not be gentle. But it was never nice down there to begin with, right, you don't want to be down there, you want to have a few generations up here, if you your goal is to understand what's going on in the universe. And if that is not your preference, if you want to have a sustainable goal, but that lack you didn't get to make the choice. These decisions were made long ago, I think the last important bifurcation that we had was when we opted in for the Industrial Revolution. And there was not much that we could change that train on that we're currently in. And I'm very much in favor of trying to make a longer game and make it more sustainable. But it's quite likely that we are unable to to return to a sustainable state or that we are able to make the present growth oriented kinds of rules world sustainable, right. But GAAP, you can look at this, oh my god, I'm so depressed because the world is going to go down from here. Or you can see, it's never been that high up. Right. And we wouldn't be talking if he wouldn't be in this giant Titanic that is heading for the iceberg.

Unknown 3:46
Okay, excellent synthesis, I will do want to know how you know that we are at the top of the parabola and not how the how we're not just going to continue going up on like a Y equals X just keep going up.

Joscha Bach 3:57
So typically, when you look at the way things happen, right, if you see some kind of growth, and if you zoom out a little bit, you'll see that it is usually part of an S curve that hits a saturation point, right. And if you zoom out even further, you see that this is going to come down, because everything that comes up tends to come down again at some point. And the question is where you are right now. And people tend to extrapolate from the current direction of the curve, and not from the logical dynamics of the overall curve. And when it becomes apparent that things are flattening out, or things might be going down, people go into denial, because they get invested in the present state of affairs, which looks like it's going up.

Unknown 4:38
We can arguably say that over the last several million years that we've been following an S curve in terms of amount of people amount of intelligence, like you said access to the world wealth of knowledge on the internet, all these great things longevity. But why is it all of a sudden going to go from this up in the S curve to a down?

Joscha Bach 4:56
I think that for the last few million years. If you take This perspective, there was mostly not many humans around right after the Toba eruption, there were a few. But a population bottleneck was I think, 7000 people or so not that many ancestors that we depend on, there were probably more people there. But those people that were successful and replace everybody was a small group, back then. And then we were, for a long time, about a million people, a million human beings roaming the planet. And then we invented agricultural societies, and probably religions, to organize them, and so on. And this got us to something like 100 million people. And at the turn of the times, when we switched to monotheistic religions, we were at something like 300 million people. And we stayed there for a long time, there was little growth and dips, if we had a war, or some famine or a big disease, and the pandemic, and then basically, the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, were still at something like 400 million. And all the Industrial Revolution got us to billions of people, the modern societies. And now these modern societies have mostly collapsed after World War Two. And we are living the aftermath of these societies that have been created, basically, in laps or people designed, the social systems that we are in that are optimized for growth, for feeding large number of people, for having mass media, to coordinate them, and so on. And these societies didn't invent good mechanisms for error correction. So they're manifestly unstable, which freaks people out right now.

Unknown 6:30
Okay, so the instability of the massive systems that are letting a billion of us play on this planet is one of the reasons why you predicted this curve goes down,

Joscha Bach 6:42
you couldn't put it another way, every organism that stays around for a long time, is playing very long game. So the basically the fitness function of the evolution needs to get to the individuals, not just in every generation, but over many generations. For instance, if you are a mouse, and you will live in a complicated ecosystem, you depend on many, many food species, if you will have food scarcity, what happens is the next generation of mice is more sparse and more scrawny, this happens for a few generation, so they don't over graze on their environment. So the species can stick around the long term if the their environment comes back and regrowth, right. And we are now in the situation that we have the choice of feeding our children, of having them being alive, or having civilization being alive, we always pick our kids, obviously, right? If you have the choice of having your children die, or having civilization die in the long run, you want your children to have a good life, you want to make them welfare, you want them to be healthy, to be educated, they should have a good house, they should have access to friends, in computer games, and so on. And because we are always confronted with this choice, and individually, we are basically unable to constrain ourselves in such a way that we don't overgraze our resources. We don't seem to have a force that would constrain us.

Unknown 8:00
But at the same time, we are heading in to a large degree towards the abundance of being able to grow our own things like meat and leather, and all these other interesting ways of being able to sustain more effectively on the planet sequester carbon, of fusion, for energy. So it's just how is it that we have either kids or long term civilization what why can't it be both providing for children and having long term civilization,

Joscha Bach 8:30
I think it might be possible, but it's not going to be all roses. If we would be doing this, we probably would have to submit to an organizing principle that is extracting a heavy toll from us. I mean, it's conceivable that we create some AI dictatorship that organizes us in such a way that we live in a few population control habitats where we can outlive our days as a species, and relative peace and harmony. Basically, some kinds of people do. But if we let people self organize, we are very much like orcs that overrun the environment, and eat everything in the past. And then when we think about how to make this sustainable, we tend to focus on this these few ideas. carbon sequestration is an excellent example. The reason why all this carbon in the atmosphere all this carbon dioxide is because by burning the carbon and into carbon dioxide, we got the fuel that building that civilization in the first place. The reason why we have 700 million people living in relative comfort is because we burned all this carbon and put it there. So basically, we are running on the depth. And paying back the steps was never in the cards. And a carbon sequestration would mean basically we would need to use a multiple of that energy to resolve the business case to get all this carbon out of the atmosphere again, and bury it in the ground in the vein, which it doesn't escape. Well, you're still burning carbon that we get out of ground, right? You're still doing this. So the easiest way of carbon sequestration would be to stop burning any carbon at all, and especially not getting new ones out of the ground if you don't do this. So I think it's a pipe dream. It's wishful thinking Game, okay, people are very good at this for thinking. It's an interesting phenomenon to observe. It's also nothing to be upset about, right? It's just how people are,

Unknown 10:08
like you said the organizing principles are the things that can keep propagating the S curve up if we can galvanize together and make these code changes within our social dynamics. Okay?

Joscha Bach 10:20
If you have something that has unlimited growth, it hits a singularity at some point, right? It's, there is no system that remained stable without symmetries.

Unknown 10:30
Okay, all right. This is excellent intro to the episode. All right, let's do the journey. So okay, born in Germany, loved computer science and AI growing up in philosophy as well. And then you ended up doing your PhD in cognitive science, you spent some time in New Zealand as well. So teach us about who you were growing up and how you even got interested in these fields.

Joscha Bach 10:53
I grew up in some some insane society, communist Eastern Germany, it had burned the down its civilization hive mind, so to speak, every philosophy was replaced by a very vulgar version of materialist, Marxist, dialectic, and everything that your teachers told you seem to be, at least to me, to my little nerd mind, insane, and unbelievable. Like, not even the mathematics was correct. I felt as a child. And I grew up as a child of an artist in the forest. So basically farewell in the big cave full of books. And then I ventured out into the world after having already read too many books I met, went to school, I was bored for eight years, then I went to a mathematics school, then I saw that what real mathematics looks like, and then I decided that it's possible to make sense of the world, but I would have to do it by myself. But to understand the meaning of a statement, what it actually means that something is true or not true, in some sense, you have to go full circle, like you have to go down to the foundations. And to make this journey to the foundations, that's in some sense, my journey. It's very hard to make this right, as an autonomous intellect, most of the autonomous intellects don't get very far. And they probably don't get very far either whenever I have tremendous insight, and typically if like 400 years late to the party, but I discovered that these parties become more interesting and obscure. They're smaller parties now that I discovered. At the same time, there are the big parties, right? large groups of people that share ideas and these large groups of people that share ideas, they are often not right, because the principles by which people get to consensus are often not TOS oriented, right. So individual minds often get it right. And groups, if they agree on the thing. That's not likely to be true, like the scientific consensus on arbitrary topics is not really something that is going to change. Like there was a for a long time and consensus about nutrition. It'd be No, no, it's, it's basically all wrong. And how is that possible? It's, I think, if we are, for instance, programmers realize it's impossible for us to even agree about simple things like which programming use for which kind of project, it's very hard to do this. And if you have a consensus about complicated questions, more complicated than this, you need a force that builds consensus. And this course is probably not choose oriented by consensus Orient, it's a political force. Right? So people with their thinking groups tend to believe things for political reasons, not because they're true. So we have to find this balance, we have to figure out and to which degree to have people proper epistemology. And this question of epistemology is in some sense, the foundation of our thinking, we should have all the possible beliefs, but shift evidence, ship the confidence according to the evidence on them, right? So we can only believe something to the degree that we have evidence for it, that it's possible that this is supported by something, I believe should not be a verb. It's not related to us, we should not be identified with our beliefs. And you should only be directed by tools. We don't get better people, if you believe the right thing or worse people, if you believe the wrong things. These are just things that we're looking at models in our mind. Let's jump into this.

Unknown 14:12
That's okay. Yeah, let's do it. This, it totally actually gave me a bunch of light bulbs when you were talking about who you are, how you became who you are. Yeah, when you were talking, I was like, Wow, this makes more sense along the way. You actually ended up moving to Cambridge as well doing some time at MIT Media Lab and Harvard evolutionary dynamics before coming out here. Yeah. Well, just quick, what was the spark that got you to move from Germany to Cambridge to the United States?

Joscha Bach 14:37
Well, I studied computer science and philosophy, I found that philosophy was not as useful as I hoped, and only later I learned that this was because of the state. The philosophy in academia is in right now. It's mostly a simulation of the real thing. It's very hard to get paid for real philosophy. You typically get paid if you're a philosopher, for being part of a particular culture of thought. Keep like a philosopher reading like a philosopher citing like a philosopher and publishing like a philosopher, it's very hard to do actual philosophy on the side, like intellectual progress, you're not incentivized to do that. And so more interesting progress, I think happens in more foundational fields like computer science, where people have a formula education, and study a little bit of psychology and physics and so on. And then I did my PhD in cognitive science. And I found it hard to fit into the academic system as it was because I was largely mostly interested in applying methods and not so much in answering the questions that I had. And so I started a few companies and co founded them, then I got an opportunity to work at MIT, which I jumped on. And so I spent some time in the US. And now I got an offer to join an amazing team in San Francisco called AI foundation where I can work on some of my ideas on how to model motivation and emotion in more detail.

Unknown 16:00
Yep, in the motivation, and emotion of how we perceive the world, as well as how machines will perceive the world is of central key to what we're going to be discussing now. So, alright, let's jump into it. We have some awesome visuals to show you guys along the way. Okay, so we find ourselves in the 3d world in the physical world, what is the relationship between the physical world and our minds?

Joscha Bach 16:28
It's an age old question, right? So we could first of all start out with this idea of what is access to the world when I was sitting in front of my first computer, a Commodore 60 Fear for about 1983. I looked at the screen, and I realized that everything that I can think of can be displayed on a screen. If I really know how to think about it, right, I can write a program that produces an arbitrary pattern on the screen, everything that I perceive is some kind of pattern. So in some sense, my access to the world, the universal there is to some kind of screen, and that screen might be my retina or my talam was, and my brain is making sense of this. And to understand the world, they need to understand what a pattern generator looks like that is responsible for producing those patterns. So we can ask ourselves what kind of computer do we need to produce the patterns that we observe, right. And it could be a discrete state machine like no Commodore 64 with a finite amount of memory. Or it could be a probabilistic state machine that randomly goes from state to state or has a certain degree of randomness in there. Or it could be some quantum computer where every state is a superposition of ground states, right. Or it could be one of these versions, but there's infinite memory. And number four is basically our discrete state machine with infinite memory is our old friend, the Turing machine, this mathematical formalization of modern computer or we could take the perspective of physics, which mostly thinks that the universe is geometric, which means things move continuously interesting, there is at some, this at the time level infinite resolution. And it could also be that it's even N equals we'll have a computer. So there could be closed timelike loops, so information could be sent back in time, all these, in some sense, mathematical possibilities. But what you have discovered is that there is a difference between mathematics and computation. Mathematics is the domain of all languages in which you can specify things. And computation is the part that can be implemented. And there's something that was discovered earlier in the 20th century. Basically, Hilbert saw some inconsistencies, especially after looking at cantor sets, they were even came to infinities to infinite sets, and the total set. And he discovered we have a problem in semantics of mathematics and the way we define truths individually find what is true at all, please mathematicians fix our meta mathematics. And so they went to work and girdle came back and said, I have bad news. You cannot really build a computer and mathematics that doesn't break while running the semantics of mathematics.

Unknown 19:07
Oh, we have a oh, there's a question. Oh,

Unknown 19:11
that shouldn't be in there.

Unknown 19:14
What are his thoughts on psychedelics? We're already getting asked about your thoughts on psychedelics from the audience. Maybe we should just take a quick What if thoughts

Joscha Bach 19:31
on I think that psychedelics relax your priors, which means they're more things that you consider to be true when you're in psychedelics, apparently, and as a result, you can make inferences that you otherwise could not make, but which are largely wrong. So it basically psychedelics might help people to escape keep local minima in the belief space, and it's the same purpose. I think what dreams have and I suspect that psychedelics are very similar to lucid dreaming And the functionality

Unknown 20:02
escaping local minimum beliefs. Yeah, that's good stuff. Yeah. But sometimes, yes, paths that can be wrong,

Joscha Bach 20:08
the thing that you enter in does not have to be a better belief. It can be one that is fundamentally more loopy, especially if you fall in love with it and don't escape that minimum again. Yeah.

Unknown 20:17
Because we can become attached to that idea. And yeah, correct versus continuing to have an open mind. Okay. Yes, give them

Joscha Bach 20:25
so chewing also worked on this problem, the same one that Google worked on. And he discovered that the same problem right tools is defined by a proofs in mathematics, something is true, if you can prove it. And approve is the reduction of a statement to axioms, it's basically a form of data compression, you compress the statement to the axioms. And the way you do this is you apply a procedure and mathematics is defined in a timeless fashion. So you can use infinite many, many steps to get there. And what guru attuning discovered is that you cannot use infinitely many steps because nobody can do this right? Nothing can do this, you cannot make the claim that something is true when you cannot actually get there. In order to actually get there, you can only use finally many steps, which means you have to redefine truths into something where you actually show the money, they actually show how to get from your axioms to the proof in a finite number of steps. So in this sense, pi, for instance, is not a value, AI is a function, you can run this function gives you a new value digits until your local 10 burns out. And this is it. But you can never have a computation that depends on knowing the last digit of pi. And it's interesting that a lot of physics behaves as if you could, because physics basically checked out this code library from mathematics without reading the comments, especially the more recent ones that were done in the first half of the 20th century. So basically, the part of mathematics that works as constructive mathematics is the thing that you can implement its computation. Which means, of course, we can build a causal hyper computer, in some sense, a computer that can send information back in time, we just do this by freezing this universe state, then running a copy of the universe into the future, taking that information and merging it into the present state and continuing, right. So in some sense, you can do this, you can not have a continuous universe, but you can have one that is arbitrarily quasi continuous that gets as close to continuity as you want. And on the level of which, where we interact, there's always too many things to count. So if you squint, it's almost like infinite. So we look at these computations of how many parts behave in the limit, which means they're almost continuous. But if you zoom in, you realize it's still integers. It's still discrete, there's still only finite amounts of information being moved around, in fact, that amount of time. So in some sense, we can use computation as a metaphor, this ability of a system to go from state to state, there's the transition function, it's a deterministic one, if it's the same one every time and at a monistic. One, if it's a different one every time. We can use this to understand all the pattern generators that computers can produce observables. But we can also build minds that observe these principles and do anything that's computable. That is make any kind of model. So basically, your Commodore 64 is enough if you give it enough memory. It's a very interesting question about quantum computers, of course, because quantum computers have been around the corner for this half a century. And we haven't gotten quite there yet. And it's interesting question why that is? Why is it that we haven't gotten quite there yet? Is it because the formalization of quantum mechanics is not completely computable? And it's only approximately true? Or is it because of something else because there's too much noise in there, maybe there is no continuous space underlying the whole thing. And the non local links create too much noise. Or another way of looking at the whole thing is that the premise of quantum mechanics is that our particle universe is inefficiently implemented on the underlying substrate. If the particle unit reverse is efficiently implemented, it can harvest the computation of the underlying substrate like imagine you live in Minecraft, and you are efficiently implementing the CPU, then your CPU is only polynomial times faster than you are right so you cannot build a computer in Minecraft that is going to be faster than the normal computations in Minecraft classical Minecraft operations. Even if you use the CPU, you're only going to be faster by some polynomial amount of time. But if Minecraft was inefficiently implemented, if it's super slowly implemented on the CPU, busy in Minecraft, you wouldn't notice. But if you could somehow harvest the computation under that is underneath it. Even if it's a classical one, it would be more than polynomial fast with respect to the computers that we can make from Minecraft particles. Right? So this is the interesting question basically, is our universe efficiently implemented or inefficiently implemented, but it's still going to be computational. Okay, so let's go back a step and let's think about what's our relationship to the universe. What's the relationship between my intent universe, right? And so the traditional

Unknown 25:03
that was an interesting priming. For the first question, oh, man, holy cow, there's, it's, it's very evident that you've taken a lot of time to synthesize these fields together into what you're presenting to us now. All right, let's see. So,

Joscha Bach 25:24
basically the idealist position that you'll find in many Eastern religions, for instance, and it's the one that we live in a dream, right reality that we perceive is not mechanical, there is something else going on. It's a dream in which magic is possible. In which you can have precognition in which you can perform rituals that change the course of the planets and human destiny and so on in which astrology works. All these things are only explainable by us not living in a mechanical universe, but in a dream universe that is driven by my mind, by mind on a higher plane of existence, right? So you can have these symbolic interactions, you make this ritual sacrifice, and as a result, your life changes. How is that possible? This is something that you can basically only explain by accepting that you live in a dream, if you think that is real. You could also say, we have a dualist situation where your mind and the universe are basically separate computers that interacts through an interface. So we have our computational mind that is making sense of the world and the other side, we have our computational universe. And the typical position that we have right now in our western world is a monist position very basically, your universe gives you the computations on which you have your mind, right, basically, the part of the universe that runs your mind is the brain. And on that brain computer, we generate interpretations of what's happening in the outside world, if you observe the world system kinds of observational interface like our readiness, and cochlea, and so on, in the surface, our body,

Unknown 26:56
okay, and why is this mono? One is

Joscha Bach 26:59
only one thing, there is not a mind, world and material world, but it's all the material world, right? It's all this primary substrate in which we exist in a monetary world. So basically, the materialist monism says the universe is mechanical. And everything that happens in your mind is part of that mechanism, okay. And what I would suggest is more correction or it's more change to this perspective, I think that these positions are of materialism. Manas, materialism and modernist idealism, you only have dreams, and you only have the material world, actually, in some sense, complimentary, I think that you need to exist in a dream. But it's a dream that is being dragged in the brain of a primate. Right, and this primate lives in the physical universe. So the mind of the on the higher plane of existence is in physics, physics is the higher plane of existence. The reason why previous civilizations, but largely not interested in describing this higher plane of existence is because they didn't have devices to play with physics, or because they didn't have social technology by which a philosopher could change the feudalist agricultural society that we're living in. And they were not putting much emphasis on this, right, if you don't get along with the world as it is, you need to change the way you perceive it, you need to change your motivations, you need to change the way you generate your dream of the world and your place in it. And if you address this, you will usually find or you're not, but you're as fine as you can be under the circumstances. Right. So basically, you focus on this inner world and how you generate your perception of reality in these techniques. And this is something that we largely don't do in the West, our western rationality was we actually leave the mind alone. And instead, if you don't like something change reality. So we focus on this outside world, and we neglect the way our perception is generated. And a lot of people, even a lot of Western philosophers are fascinatingly unaware of the fact that we live in a dream that the same circuits that makes dreams at night, they make a dream during the day, only the dream during the day is tuned to predict your sensory patterns. Right, so it's a model that we make, what is the model?

Unknown 29:10
When we're in our dream space, and when we're in our awake space, we are running. We're using same neural architecture with within ourselves for both of those situations. Yet, there is a in the in the physical world, there is a a there is a this

Joscha Bach 29:39
this machine made from neurons.

Unknown 29:41
And there's there's a a, you called it a dream, a dream, a dream state that we're in, in the body of a primate Yes. But the monism is that it's all good In the, in this

Joscha Bach 30:01
or that it's basically only a mechanical universe and the mechanical universe creates emergent patterns. But the art is real as a character in a novel. You and me are characters in multimedia novel that has been altered by the brain.

Unknown 30:15
Genre my own movie. Challenge star of our own movies all of us. Yeah, but all star of our own movies are star of collective, a collective movie,

Joscha Bach 30:29
there is no way they can get out of their individual dream, a collective as part of your dream. It's not that other minds tell you want to do you interpret the part of the universe of the patterns that you see on your readiness as being emanations of other people or their minds or your invention?

Unknown 30:46
Or their minds are my invention?

Joscha Bach 30:48
Yes. Do you perceive other minds to the degree that you can proceed my mind that you construct the model of it that you think I'm a sentient being that you can interact with? But this interaction takes place entirely in your own mind? Yes.

Unknown 31:06
Okay, yeah, there's so much to yeah,

Joscha Bach 31:11
there's no way to make up for the stream and ever you'll find yourself immersed in reality, you are in a trance state, but you basically take some representation and think you are inside of that. It's a similar trance to when you see a movie, right? When you see a movie, you suspend your disbelief, and you are that cowboy that sees the Wild West, and you're right along the prairie, and then suddenly, the light goes on, you realize, oh, my God, this is all not true, I'm in a different reality now, right. And you cannot wake up from that one. At least, you cannot wake up from it without losing what makes you human. But makes lets you make sense of the world.

Unknown 31:48
And there's there's a, the my ability to change the way that I perceive versus changing a physical world, that was one of the points that you made. So we can kind of upgrade our own perception of reality, and the way that we engage with the reality that we're embedded in versus trying to necessarily change that physical reality, it's often

Joscha Bach 32:13
also very necessary that you've come aware of that, right? For instance, if you have self hatred, you're perceived that the universe is mean to you, that you're experiencing many ways is basically the universe treats you badly. And you also treat yourself badly, because part of your software does not really buy into you, it thinks this thing that you are is very flawed and should not really be supported. Right. So if you don't like yourself, you're going to punish yourself at some sense, which means your mind is going to create a simulation, in which reality treats yourself badly. And this will sometimes lead to bad outcomes sometimes might lead to better ones, there is a reason why your mind thinks this is the best setup. But this perception that you have revealed reality is virtual, this identification that you have is your beliefs. And your experience is something that's generated inside of your mind. It's basically like a group that is pulled to record in a record player. And the record is the groove of your life. And you're being pulled through this and when you dream, you can put this move into something else, or when you are in the psychedelic state, like our friend here as right and so this identification is what you feel about your experience. In some sense. It's your can become your choice you can you become responsible for this.

Unknown 33:30
So I can I can simulate a self hatred state or I can simulate a self love state. Yes. And so upgrading my perception is upgrading the way that I choose which I sit, which I simulate, which is which I collapse into my reality, you could

Joscha Bach 33:45
also get to a neutral state in which will realize that all these evaluations that you put on there, where you think that you are super lovable, or super flawed, are actually not helpful or not truthful. And you just are you're just a physical system. And you're not in the category of things that has the ability to be adequate or inadequate. You just exist, and you do this.

Unknown 34:09
Okay, yes, yes.

Joscha Bach 34:13
Good. So how do we make models a model is basically a set of variables, things that can change into relationships between them, the relationships are the things that don't change the invariances, right? They, the relation between the different variables is, for instance, the laws of perspective, they don't change the world in which we exist, that's an invariance in the laws of perspective dictate if I see your nose and your nose points in a particular direction, which is a free variable. It predicts the position of your face, your face would point in the same direction as your notes. Otherwise, I'm looking at somewhere it's impossible. So these relationships are, in some sense, they are possibilistic. And the world that you're in is not a probable what's possible. without even if a tiger comes up to you, and it is not probable, it would still be possible to represent this right. And we will always try to find an interpretation of our sensory patterns that is possible where every feature that you perceive is compatible according to the relationship that we've learned to all the others. But in order to get there, we need to learn probability, because there are infinitely many possible states or almost infinitely many. And so when we see a bunch of patterns, after we pick up in the morning, we need to converge on one of these possible states. So we

Unknown 35:30
know that your nose being pointed a certain ways where your face is going to be pointed with almost 100% accuracy almost.

Joscha Bach 35:39
If not, then we have learned that there are footnotes, so we will put our attention on this thing where we have this inconsistencies, and we will try to resolve it. And this means usually the extent the model, and this is largely how we learn, we discover inconsistencies in our models, and then we extend them by adding new relationships or modifying existing ones, right. And if we have a model that already works most of the time, then we need a way to get it to converge to what we currently perceive the patterns that we have an environment need to be interpreted with a particular kind of model. So we get this model state by following probability, the probability tells you if I see the following patterns, it's likely that the following model should apply. And I should interpret the world in this particular way. And these links are responsible, for instance, for optical illusions, they're shortcuts that make us see the world in a particular way, even though it might be different. But it helps you to speed up your convergence to a particular state. That's why we have many of these illusions. And then we have the preferences, they give color to our perception, right? It's not just all meaningless, interesting structural patterns, it's there is something going on that is relevant to us that because you can give us pleasure and pain and these preference relationships. They tell us how certain things deviate from a target instead of just measuring them absolutely right. So in some sense, this measurement that is not absolute, but relative is an identification where you think something should be like this, instead of that, it's like this.

Unknown 37:04
And this is where we could say within the model, there are motivations, yes, and the motivations guide us towards the preference. Yes.

Joscha Bach 37:10
And the preference means you are a system that wants to change these things towards the preference. So when you feel pain, you might have a preference to make that pain and and it's sometimes it's the nature of that pain, right. Or if you will feel that you live in a world that is not just, you might feel a pain that directs you on making it more just and you identify with this, you realize I am a system that is directed on making the world more just, and it is some imposition on the world that you make, and it might be a good one, it might have good outcomes, we might also be that interest will never existed and wouldn't even work. But it's a commitment that your mind makes that you should perceive the world in a particular way the world should be different than it is. And this sense that the world should be different than it is that's the purpose of the existence of our mind is to help the organism to regulate for its evolutionary needs.

Unknown 38:01
And when we are when we are born into the world do we have within us already the DNA for the preferences and for the motivations for what our character decides is the thing that's our North Star?

Joscha Bach 38:18
towards some degree? I think so I have found that in my own children. after they're born, they had very strong preferences. And eventually what became more detail was not the preferences, but their ideas, their own ideas of what exactly the preferences are, and how to realize them. And that largely depends on the environment. But I suspect that the things that make you happy or unhappy are things that are determined innately in the organism. Yeah, and also make sense, right? Because motivation is not adaptive. It's resistive motivation is how you resist physics and society and everything else. It's not to give in just goes into a puddle on the ground. It's where you push against reality. It's about your regulate. So it needs to be innate, cannot be adaptive.

Unknown 39:05
We're running within us the motivations that we want to adapt with change our perception, but also as well in the reality that we live in with what we want to do in that reality how we want to change that reality towards those motivations. Those perfect

Joscha Bach 39:22
of course, we can learn to change this to some degree, we can learn to this identify certain certain things, but it's hard and it typically happens relatively late in our life. Yes, yes. Okay. So, basically, the control of this organism starts with feedback loops, and they are implemented in our brainstem, all our reptilian sites, so to speak. So, there are lots of feedback loops that regulate your breathing patterns, heart rate, your body movements and so on. And as soon as it becomes so complicated that it cannot be done automatically. It you create models of this in your neocortex and in between you have these identifications where you should

Unknown 40:00
So this is your this is autonomic nervous system blinking heart rate. Yeah, yeah.

Joscha Bach 40:05
But you can make all these things, you can submit them to your own control and usually do so when they automatic regulation fails, then you will spawn some cortical process that takes care of regulating your reality.

Unknown 40:20
So the most primordial feedback loops are at the most limbic earliest,

Joscha Bach 40:26
I think they can be made available here at the brainstem, because they have the potential that they need to be regulated. For instance, if you, your health becomes fragile, you might need to pay attention to your heart rate, and you can learn how to regulate your heart rate. But as long as that's not necessary, because your autonomic regulation of the heart rate is perfect, you're aware of your heart rate. And I suspect this happens for almost all the things you have, whenever your feedback loops are sufficient, you don't need to pay attention, and you don't need to run lots of quantum computations on it. And the attention is necessary to create new mental processes that then become automated. And as soon as they are automatic, you usually don't spend attention on them anymore, which means you cannot remember them. They're not You're not no longer conscious of them, right.

Unknown 41:13
And then if we want to remember we need to go through the process of going through that, yeah, tedious remembering of how to do that.

Joscha Bach 41:19
So the limbic system is, in some sense, implementing a machine of motivation, where you have social and cognitive and physiological needs, and they all compete, yes, and they create different pleasure and pain signals. And when we act, we don't just act on pleasure and pain, we act on models of them, which you could call purposes. And these needs don't form a hierarchy, they just coexist and compete. They don't form a hierarchy, no need stressed coexist, they might be have different strengths. But there are people that might starve because they serve political goals, or because their children are more important to them, right? It's not that you first sort of existential safety, and then you do the revolution, or then you do the art, it might be that you do this all at the same time. And you just get drawn to these things in different proportions. And depending on the opportunity, and the relative strength of the need at a given moment, you are more drawn to this or more drawn to that. But when you want to coordinate your life, you need to make models of them, you need to understand concepts like survival survival itself, I don't think it's a neat, it's too complicated. But you need to understand this. Now, in order to understand survival test is a complicated concept was difficult to understand for my children, to remember when they realized, oh, some organisms stop moving at some point and or people at some point, they're no longer around. And this will also happen to me. And it's something that happens relatively late, it's not in the first few months. But in the first few months, you already have pain avoidance, and some sense of existential safety, and so on, you only combined this into a purpose of survival when you are able to form the model. And these purposes, they need to form a hierarchy. So they become accountable to each other. And this hierarchy has different solutions and different people. So in some sense, the shape of your soul is the hierarchy of your purposes. And the top note is usually not the ego, the ego is just a function that integrates the expected reward over the next 50 years. Also, the really interesting functions are above that, where you serve long ranging purposes. And this allows us to cooperate because we said if she had purposes, yes, I think that's at the core of this altruistic Love is the discovery of shared purpose and others.

Unknown 43:27
Yes, so the North Star that we find most meeting in doing every single day, usually transcends our own ego towards the shops shared purpose,

Joscha Bach 43:37
that's you also realize your ego is just a lot of work. Why do you keep it up? Right? There needs to be an underlying purpose to make that necessary. You need to be relatively stupid to think everything is only important for your ego, because you're not thinking very far, because you're not getting much out of the ego. Ultimately, it's not creating that much pleasure to have an ego.

Unknown 44:00
Gosh, this part is such a mixed bag of motivations, even right there, cognitive, physiological and social gets a huge mixed bag. And however we end up determining what the next step is, is a huge mystery at times. Yeah.

Joscha Bach 44:21
I suspect it gets more boring when you figure it all out, right. And you always know what the next step is.

Unknown 44:29
Yeah, definitely gets more boring if Well, if you you know, hopefully, when we run the simulations, we can gain more insight through these processes. And, yeah, looks like we're already potentially in an 80 year process of leveling up some character. Yeah.

Joscha Bach 44:48
Imagine you had an Elon simulation that tells you always what your next step is that out models you and thinks a few steps ahead and tells you these are your options and this is the one that you're going to pick this is the one that you should be picking

Unknown 44:59
for Yeah. We can potentially visualize that even right now. Right? What? Yeah, what is the next best option? Correct. And to be able to be in a state of constantly engaging with that is beautiful. Yeah. But it's also it can be takes all the mystery away. Yeah. Okay. Neurons live in.

Joscha Bach 45:26
Thought about how is the neuron able to do this, when they do AIB typically think about how to impose the bill of the mind on matter. So when you think about how Minsky build AI had an idea of how things work, and then you implement this as an algorithm that plays chess, or does whatever, right. And now we live in the second phase of AI, where we have systems that discovered this solution to a problem. So we give a problem and loss function that tells the system how to evaluate us on the problem to the algorithm. And the algorithm figures out how to implement this solution. But it's still very top down centralized control. And our new ones are doing it very differently every day, there is no centralized control in the brain, because everything has to be implemented as individual cells, the cell is the smallest unit there from some perspective, and also take different ones where it's even smaller, and it's molecules within the cells, right. But if you take the cell as this smallest unit of compression, then you have your neuron and then your and in some sense, it lives in the darkness. It's, it's a small animal that tries to get fit, and they link up embryonal neurons in the petri dish, and they try to find connections to each other. And they try to learn which signals in the environment predict anticipated reward. So which which signals they should fire on, to get fed and in return, in this sense all day

Unknown 46:50
to work, dopamine is our reward.

Joscha Bach 46:53
So financially, dopamine is globally for the brain responsible for reward, it also has a few other local roles, I suspect, what happens is that the brain is very good at making a few dozen chemicals. Some of these chemicals are can be very quickly exchanged, some of them more slowly, and it uses them as a language. And the words of this this language, one of these words, is dopamine, this molecule, they mean something different in different contexts. And when you, for instance, use it dopaminergic drugs like Adderall, it often interacts with other systems that use the same language. So in striatum, dopamine means something different than in the prefrontal cortex. And as a result, you get might get more control, but you also get more tics. Yeah, right. So it's because it's not one thing, it's just a particular kind of language that is being spoken between the neurons. But the from the individual neurons, some of them are more thorough to logic neurons, and they get rewarded by acting on serotonin.

Unknown 47:48
Yes, yes. Okay. Okay. And then they're moving towards what brings the highest reward towards the motivation, the preferences,

Joscha Bach 47:59
basically, your neurons will

Unknown 48:01
learn whatever you feed them for whatever you feed them for. So

Joscha Bach 48:05
the basically the your organism is setting up the brain in such a way that in humans get fed, if they regulate what you want to regulate. If

Unknown 48:12
if the if the trajectory that I'm collapsing is in the area of self doubt, pity, sadness, disparity, etc, that there's going to be a feedback system within my brain in that direction versus collapsing towards self love care, harmony with others. So so there's there is a neurological process that's occurring with the way that neurons are firing and wiring together.

Joscha Bach 48:43
Yes, this is already super high level, and there are many predefined circuits with respect to controlling your social interactions, and so on. And if you don't have certain priors built inside of your brain, you're probably not going to figure this out their high functioning autistic people that are not very social. Because they didn't start out with the same priors. Their life was not long enough to converge to the same optimal as other people did. And then it's also this question, is it an optimal? Yeah, correct. Is it serving the individual or the species or whatever? It's directing that evolution optimally? And that's something that you can only see when you zoom very far out. Yeah. So but on the lowest level, for instance, neurons try to predict the patterns in the environment, and we act on them. And so the way we perceive reality, I think, can be understood like a synthesizer. Okay. So for instance, when you get signals coming in from your cochlea, you don't take the frequencies of sound because neurons cannot oscillate at 20 kilohertz. You wouldn't like to oscillate at something like 20 hertz. So you first decompose the sound into different energy spectra, and you have little hairs is a snake like organ, or it's snail like organ in your inner ear, and they react depending on the energy of the sound at different frequencies. And they sent it to the brain. And the brain is now trying to make sense of these patterns. And it makes sense of these patterns by being able to predict them. So when the sound starts, it tries to continue the sound to know what's happening next. And when it does this, it's able to explain it. So you can do this very similar to a synthesizer, you have a few knobs, and you have an oscillator. And there's some almost random connection of circuits. And you tune them until you get the sound you want. And when you're used to your particular synthesizer, you get pretty good at this, right. And you don't only do this for sound, but you can also do this for vision. So you will look for spatial frequencies for colors, and so on. And you build lots and lots of synthesizers in your brain that are able to predict and continue these patterns once they start occurring. And once they are done with training, and they don't get better, you combine the synthesizers and try to find the metal patterns, the patterns in the patterns and across different modalities. And so you find, for instance, percepts, you realize that different sounds are related by pitch, you can explain a family of sounds by just changing the pitch between them, or the loudness, you get a new method.

Joscha Bach 51:14
And ultimately, you get some thing where unify all the simulations, and all the products in your mind. And what you get is a cohesive simulation where everything moves around in three dimensional space, because the simplest explanation that we can find for the things that are going on in our cochlea and a field of vision,

Unknown 51:30
okay, so we have both auditory input and visual input here, and tactile input as well. But so what you're, what you're explaining is that we have a way with our auditory senses to slowly build layers of strip that give us something, then visually, same thing, build layers that give us something and then we smash even these together to give us this Yes,

Joscha Bach 52:00
movie until we get a unified model of the world. And that's basically the biggest unsolved task in AI how to do this unified model of the world, instead of having a bunch of classifiers that react to individual feature complexes and the world learn everything into a single function into one universe. And this is what we're able to do, right? You, you try to make sense of the universe in one function. There is one way in which the reality works. Yeah.

Unknown 52:23
And it's such a beautiful thing here that is able to take in all of the different senses and create that model. But with AI, this is the Grand Challenge, one of

Joscha Bach 52:37
the grandchild is basically the way to have for us to think about this and take this to the next level. In some sense, the, because the biggest step in the maturation of a mind is understanding its own nature, it's understanding how we work, and AI is the best trends that we have in finding that out by making testable theories,

Unknown 52:54
and to be able to take in that much more information and compute on all that is creatively run all the permutations I mean, that's like, a massive holy grail for for advancing us and yeah, okay, this is great. This is great.

Unknown 53:16
Anyway, like, Who's, who's in charge of AI? Your thoughts?

Joscha Bach 53:24
Our own AI, or which AI?

Unknown 53:27
Just the AI? In AI, we trust the AI that is going to become our, our God, our government?

Joscha Bach 53:37
You mean, like in Game of Thrones, where you have? Over 80?

Unknown 53:46
So who is in charge of the AI? That becomes the super intelligence? Who's in charge of the super Intel?

Joscha Bach 53:53
It's a interesting open question. I mean, how can we know now, it's difficult to predict things, especially when they are in the future? And so why should it be who like a human being at the moment, we typically put a single human being at the top of a company or of a state? And I think that is for a particular reason. It's not obvious, right? Why don't you have a team to run for president? Yeah, if an individual would be able to achieve anything without having the right team, right? If you have the wrong team, you're not going to achieve anything under any circumstances. It's complicated. And so the team really makes you feel secure. But why is this individual? And I think it's because if we have a system that has very complex rules, we cannot really express this well as an algorithm. It's too brittle. It's too easy to get this wrong. And if you have a committee if you have a group that makes the decisions, you basically need to come down to rules of compromise and so on. And the rules are not always the best solution. Right? If you think every decision should be done by voting between a group of individuals that you associate with a certain function, you will discover their circumstances but this was not the best solution. The end is definitely means that there is an alternative, which is always the best solution. So the use of what you need to do if you want to put the system in a particular direction, eventually they need to be implemented in a single mind. Because the single mind is right now the most complicated information processing system that is completely integrated with itself, it makes sense of the world in particular way that we have. So in some sense, when isn't the German elections are about not just having party politics battling it out against each other, but by finding the best German, the most German German of of their generation. And the results are mixed a little bit, but most Germans think that it's largely successful. So in some sense, Angela Merkel is the most German, German or for a generation from some particular perspective, and she embodies where this country should go. And she's the one that ultimately makes a lot of the decisions, not all the details, and a lot of checks and balances and oversight and many boards and so on. But this main direction that you cannot express all in rules and codes of conduct, and so on, they need to be implemented in a single individual sense. And when we give everything to an AI, the question is, do we do this right? Is this thing? Or do we need to have a human envelope? And if you do this, are we going to increase the fallacy of this human being like we did in German fascism, right? We have a tightly controlled system that removes a lot of the redundancy makes the system extremely powerful and effective. But if this guy at the top is insane, horrible things happen. So this is the same dangerous AI, of course, how can you make sure that you're not accidentally implementing something that you would think is insane? And what is sane, right? Yes. Is it not insane to make up a monkey. And it's not a nice monkey. It's a pretty violent monkey from the perspective of basically every other species aspect, maybe the parasitic species that parasite has on humans, like dogs and cats, and so on. We are pretty wild. Trees probably don't like us very much.

Unknown 56:56
Yeah, there again, there's just so many good things there that I've really appreciated how you said that there's a time when there's an optimal function for the dynamically adjusting system that can see when it's best for a team to step up and handle something versus an individual to step up and handle something, or the collective to handle something. There's the adjusting of a super intelligence to be able to handle things like that. And just like the governance structures of today's civilization, but yeah, is it insane to wake up in a monkey suit? Yes, it is very insane to wake up in a monkey suit. Why aren't we waking up and other things yet? Well, maybe we will create the substrates that enable us to walk wake up in different suits, Dolphin. Ron wants to wake up in a dolphin, UK for a couple hours, couple of days, you

Unknown 57:42
know, a lifetime a lifetime.

Unknown 57:43
Yeah, I want to bounce between like Eagle octopus, I want to go outside of this universe to other designer universes that are not like this one that are not governed in this way.

Joscha Bach 57:55
This is good story about what I'm not studying. While Hearthstone is we're doing some Sufi mystic that may have existed at some point. And he is going to a bank and he's being asked to identify himself, and he pulls out his mirror and he looks in the mirror and says, it seems to be me. Yeah. That's a very interesting question. What do you recognize when you see in the mirror? Yeah. What is that thing? What is it that you are?

Unknown 58:21
Exactly? Yes. Yes. Great question. Great question.

Joscha Bach 58:25
So maybe there's nothing there. And that's, maybe there is nobody in charge, maybe it's an emerging thing that invents every moment in you person to be in charge. And that person thinks it's useful because it believes it shares memories busy or to upload you it's very simple, just making machine that thinks it's you. Something for friends might disagree, but just upload them to

Unknown 58:47
Iran definitely feels that way.

Joscha Bach 58:49
Yeah, so we've heard the neurons, the neurons form columns, the columns of a function approximator, as they talk to each other. Basically, humans form small teams, that because they discover that they're better at anticipating reward and how to get fit if they form these teams, and organizational units. And this is a process that you're not able to replicate yet. So the algorithms that our machines are implementing right now are much more. You could say primitive, but maybe not primitive. Thought top down or bottom up. And it's very hard to think bottom up as many moving parts, it's much easier for us to think top down in terms of control, not have emergent control.

Unknown 59:24
We kind of do the same thing in society as human that is a neuron that maps together in the hive mind that is civilization. Yeah. Because we're more optimally get the electricity and education and all that stuff together. Yeah. Then, like you said, in an ad your lifetime, you'd never be able to learn how to create a language. Yeah, so we got lucky. And we got the language. Yeah. Okay.

Joscha Bach 59:49
So our brain is made from these building blocks from cortical columns. And these columns organized into maps into these brain areas. We have about 50 of those and they're linked together and talk to each other and they basically they take these patterns dependents are visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, emotional, and our imaginations and so on, organize this into percepts. And these perceptual proprioceptive, again is your body. So what does it feel like? Where your limbs are, for instance? And

Unknown 1:00:19
how is that not tactile?

Joscha Bach 1:00:22
Tactile is your body's outside tactiles? Outside

Unknown 1:00:25
proprioceptive is insights. For instance,

Joscha Bach 1:00:27
if you feel that your limbs are moving in a particular way, it's not necessarily a tactile feeling. But it's a sense when you are in space.

Unknown 1:00:34
Okay, okay, so spatial and spatial,

Joscha Bach 1:00:38
the spatial thing is constructed, but if you have instant acceleration, and so on, okay, yeah, got it, got it. And you combine this into simulation, so you take the visual, auditory and part of the tactile stuff, combine this into your model of the environment, you take the tactile and proprioceptive stuff, and this is somatosensory, you take the proprioceptive, emotional, and emotional stuff that exists your motivational experiences that you have with hunger and thirst, and so on and pain. And then we have emotional imaginations, which gives rise to a mental world. And the part of that inner of this mental motivation somatosensory world gets combined into a model of the self. And another part gets combined into a model of the world around you. Right. So we're going

Unknown 1:01:19
patterns to perceptions to then are these combined into us into our worldviews,

Joscha Bach 1:01:27
but they're not being perceived by anything, because they're not related to something they will be related to the self. And the self starts out as being somatic, social and personal, right. So you will relate to others. And this is important parts of yourself, relate to your own body, that's an important part of yourself. And you relate to yourself as a person, you have a biography and expectations and desires. And all this is what you think you are, right. And then you have your mental stage in your simulations, as this world states that you cannot actually there are not factual that are memories that are imaginations, that are constructions that you do on your mind, things that you imagine. And we also need to generalize over the world states and to global maps, and the unify our knowledge about ourselves and the world into into knowledge. And then you have an attentional system conductor orchestra. And this gives you an attentional self that tells you this is what I'm currently focused on. Right? Yes. And this attentional stuff is very important for selecting percepts. directing attention to things. And yeah, and it helps you also to control your simulations. So this control is done by the self, the self gives you the information while you're controlling

Unknown 1:02:40
the attentional system is so critical in the process, especially as we're in the attention economy, where we're being dragged around by the devices in the business plans, and the beeps, and the boots and other people trying to get our attention. So to be able to parse adequately towards the North Star, and be able to have a strong feedback loop is such a critical part of this. I like how you broke it down so carefully. And I know we're still going but I love the nuance of the breakdown. Thanks. It's so good.

Joscha Bach 1:03:15
So the control of the attention is really from the south, It's I who pays attention because I need this because I want this because I don't want that. Right, this is what directed. And in order to remember what you did in the past, you have maintained a protocol and this protocol of what you paid attention to that's basically your stream of consciousness. And this enables your biographical self. Lets you remember, I was the person that did that. And I did this a moment ago, I did this that last year and so on this works by a biographical memory Yes. And so this is basically the rough architecture of something that's self and a person emerge in a mind that makes models the brain itself is not conscious humans are not conscious they're just physical system physical systems cannot be conscious, but it would be very useful for a mind to know what it would be like to be conscious so it creates a simulation of a conscious being in a dream world. And we are that simulacrum of a conscious being only a simulation can be conscious and people think the simulation cannot be conscious, but they got it backwards. Only a simulation can.

Unknown 1:04:18
Only a simulation can because consciousness

Joscha Bach 1:04:21
is a simulator property, it's not a physical property

Unknown 1:04:24
consciousness is a simulated property

Joscha Bach 1:04:27
of the primary conscious do I really experienced this and your mind says yes, you are totally experienced. Okay, hold

Unknown 1:04:33
on. So So then a dog is also running their own simulation. Yeah. Okay. And then a, but then the question of this whole unity, the whole all that is all is consciousness also.

Joscha Bach 1:04:48
There is this illusion that people have that they think that the dream is the physical reality. There is a physical roundels and this physical ground truth is not conscious. As far as we know. It does not talk to us. It doesn't seem to Want anything from us the physical universe as far as we can see, it's just a computer, it doesn't care. The reason why you perceive the world as meaningful is because it's generated in your mind to model your meaning. And the poor of this meaning is typically you the thing that is buried below the obelisk. The hidden referent of all these mystical symbols is always you, you will always the chosen one

Unknown 1:05:22
show that the tree has consciousness. I'm not

Joscha Bach 1:05:26
sure about that. We're not sure about this. I don't I'm not. Some people might be. I don't have a clear answer for this. I don't have evidence that tells me whether a tree is conscious or not. Okay. Okay. So I'm agnostic.

Unknown 1:05:39
Okay, interesting. But like with the dog and the other even insect a fly? I'm not

Joscha Bach 1:05:44
sure if flights are conscious, a dog? Yes, I think dogs are sufficiently similar to us. And they have many properties where you would think yeah, they do run a simulation in which they have a self and they attribute properties to the self in relation to the environment, and they have some inner protocol. So basically, they have all the elements of that

Unknown 1:06:01
feels like a fly also does somewhat similar, less of this likely of Yes, and then sing with the tree. And just in terms of making the decision making systems and the communication systems and the routes and, and the atmosphere of

Joscha Bach 1:06:21
supplies, when they perceive the world, they seem to be mostly modeling a flow fields. So when we see the world that first step mentioned, you are some kind of frog. So you live under a dome in the hemisphere. And in this hemisphere, there are sometimes black dots moving which are edible. Yes. And you just need to target them in this 2d world. If they are close enough, you get them? Yes. So you basically need to realize when they move in a particular pattern, and they are large enough, yes. And you can get them. And you also realize how this dome is changing when you move, right. So there's a flow field in which things move around, it's not clear that frogs are able to generalize over the domes into a 3d world and realize, okay, they don't live in a sequence of domes that they can go between by moving in certain patterns. But that is a cohesive world that gives rise to all these dorms like veto and talks. And flights probably don't have an idea of his video world.

Unknown 1:07:12
Okay. Okay, okay. All right. And then But then the physical world though the All That Is, is consciousness, the pan psychist view you are you are like no is

Joscha Bach 1:07:21
known, it's an internal observation that you're making phenomenologically it's true, because you realize that everything that you can perceive is generated by your mind is editable by your mind. Okay, so in some sense, this is accurate phenomenologically, you can see from the inside, that everything that you perceive is a representation generated by your mind, and it's all changeable. There is no limit to the as you can tell a five year old model, the fact that there is an omnipotent being, which means has full right access on your memory and perception. And while they have got in a world that is changing the world and makes miracles happen,

Unknown 1:07:54
okay. All right. All right. So let's continue.

Joscha Bach 1:07:57
So another thing that the attention learning is system is doing is learning our neural networks learn layer by layer, usually, it's relatively slow and inefficient, because we need to change so many links. So imagine you want to teach a neural system to play tennis, and you do this end to end learning, every time you do the reading in the wrong way, you will have to change all the links in the perceptual system has to be adapted and so on. It's only that you by accumulating lots and lots of training data, all these changes cancel each other out, except for the change that you need to make to get better at playing tennis. And you can improve on this very slow algorithm by pinpointing the position like improving my upper upper hand or something like this, this attention, and this is what your conductor is doing. So when you want to get better at tennis, you say, okay, when this ball comes like this, I will move my hand, slightly different than I normally do whenever like this. And I hope that this following thing will emerge. And this is what you do on your political memory. And a few moments later, when you see how this worked out, you'll recall original situation and you can reinforce or undo the change. And this is a very efficient learning algorithm that our brain is using. And our machines are only beginning to approximate.

Unknown 1:09:10
And then we can shortcut the learning algorithms by having mentors or going out into the social world and learning from others how to better play tennis so that we don't have to experience the rookie mistake,

Joscha Bach 1:09:23
yes. But it also means that not only we have to have a model of our own architecture, so we in order to make that happen to have this attentional learning, you need to know the fact that in order to win a tennis, you need to move your hand in a particular way. And it's hand control is done in a particular part of your cognitive architecture and how you can control this particular thing, right. And if you want to be a good trainer at this, you also need to learn this architecture of the other person and their control architecture, how to direct their attention on that particular thing. And the better you are, the more effective you are as a teacher, there are teachers that can play teach you to play decent tennis In less than an hour and the others, they take weeks, because they're not able to

Unknown 1:10:04
direct your attention. That's right. Yeah. Well said yes, yes.

Joscha Bach 1:10:08
So another part is what happens if like in tennis, it takes a while until you see the result, it might take a few seconds or may take minutes until the mattress over. And many things that we change the only see about how the crops turn out next year. So that's why you need to have this long term memory in this long term stored consciousness, this very divided span of that stream of attention. But when you see the changes immediately, this is when you do want things on your mental stage, you reason. So reason is, in some sense, learning that was immediate results, you try something and you immediately see in your mind your mental simulation of how it turns out, and then you fix it. And then you go on to the next step. And this step by step improvement of a mental representation is the same thing. I think as attentional learning is enabled by the same mechanisms. So this conductor is therefore reasonings conscious, because it's done by this mechanism that uses protocol memory, and this conductor system to see to effect a change and see how it turns out and sees whether needs to be reinforced, rundown, yes, yes. So in some sense, these different modules are done by an orchestra, while brain areas something like 50 or so brain areas could be seen as something like 50 instruments that talk to each other, they basically listen to the music of their neighbors to the surface of the music they are doing. And you have a conductor that directs your attention between them and then from Dr. is controlling what you are playing tonight. If you don't have this conductor, you might still be doing interesting things. But your might be a sleepwalker.

Unknown 1:11:39
This right here. Interesting. So the conductor is the dlpfc. Yeah, yes. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex interesting, at

Joscha Bach 1:11:52
least, that's my hypothesis. So I think it's actually a combination of stuff that happens in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the insula and the thalamic. Loop. And hippocampus plays an important role in storing the scripts that you basically manage maintaining the scene graph of the situation that you're in, and your plans, but the actual attention seems to be directed from there. As far as I understand,

Unknown 1:12:19
and, and hippocampus, you said, has a script, like that way of explaining it is quite interesting. So taking all of the, the the 100 billion orchestra members and directing them, each one of them contributing very important information to the they're not

Joscha Bach 1:12:45
individually not that important. The amazing thing is that you can kill a few neurons, and usually nothing happens. And how is that and it's because every neuron itself is not doing much more than passing on signals. And if an individual neuron dies, you can put a new neuron in there, and it will learn how it needs to function to get the same reward as the neurons before it. So it's largely going to play this same, very, very small part in larger pattern. And the functional units are much larger. They're assemblies of neurons, like cortical columns, that learn more complicated functions. And they're robust against the loss of individual neurons. And even if you lose a larger brain area, what's probably going to happen if you have some brain lesion and so on, but the brain should be doing and the circumstances and what probably does, it stops the other parts from adapting to the change for a while. So then, if you put the new ones in there, and this part recovers, they can get the same rewards as before, if you would be adapting immediately to the loss of this area, and you get new neurons in from stem cells, and so on, then they, the rest of the brain would have to learn to route around this and what also lose functionality. And by keeping this functionality potentially intact, for instance, imagine you lose the body image of your right hand. Because you had a brain lesion after you play boxing or something like this. You're basically you've tried to rebuild this area. And instead of trying to make do with a world in which you don't have a right hand or not a representation of your right hand and subjectively, you don't notice it anymore, which is very confusing. You basically work with the placeholder that your right hand is relatively foggy and gets more structured and more detailed over time again. So the individual contribution is not that important. The important thing is really it all needs to make sense in the big pattern. There is only a particular universe that can can contain you, there are not many possible universes in which you can be contained. And this constrains what music the individual orchestra members can play and the smaller they are, the less the more expensive they are and the more they have to adapt to the structures around them.

Joscha Bach 1:14:52
So are we individually intelligent when we are able to model a certain thing how to be a monkey In the civilization, and we don't get very far in seeing the big patterns, I think individually, humans are not generally intelligent. In order to be generally intelligent, you need to have an intellectual tradition. And it's the whole tradition that is intelligent, right. And I think this idea of a civilizational intellect that is being built over many generations a global optimum of the modeling function, that is the idea of the Tower of Babel. It's like the founding most of our civilization. And that thing was destroyed because people started to speak different languages. So this edifice, to reach the heavens to understand the nature of meaning to understand how we route reality, to understand our relationship to the universe, and how it works. This requires that lots of lots of specialized people talk to each other over many generations. And humanity largely doesn't have 1000 years of unbroken intellectual tradition. Usually, somebody opens the doors and words the mathematicians if there's a revolution, and burns down the libraries, and then a couple generations later, the knowledge worker drones of the next newly established King realize what's important. And they get tasked with rebuilding this intellect that existed before, and they make something in its likeness. And often they get the foundations wrong. And this happens all the time and our own civilization, intellect, our own newly erected Tower of Babel. Basically, his scars after the Roman Empire failed, we have been governed by a cult for over 1000 years. And this was intellectually very dark age, it was an age and Debbie seriously asked people to believe that talking to a burning bush on the mountain is a meaningful experiment that tells you something about nuance and about the nature of reality. And if you are unwilling to profess to this belief, then there are grave consequences for you as an individual, so you better had to shut up. Which means it's very hard to have an intellectual discourse in such a world, a world where most people don't agree on on ways to discuss truth is a very scary place to be for a mind that tries to capture reality and truth. Right? Yes. And that's also the thing that scares me when we constrained our discourse away from tourists in our society, it makes it much harder to discover tools. And it's not that people don't know what's true. At some level, most of them have an idea what's true, they just unwilling to think about it or talk about it. There's a saying, it's very hard sometimes to wake a sleeping person, but it's impossible to make up somebody who only pretends to sleep. And religion largely works by asking people to pretend to sleep to pretend or an annual Audrey also works like this, there is a certain thing where you realize, oh, reality is not quite like this. But the part of me that thinks this is flawed. And I need to fight this part inside of me, because it's not really good. It doesn't submit to the principles of goodness, that all my friends and we agree on, and all the good people agree on it. And we get ostracized from the family of good people, if I start thinking through things that are not good. So this is a big danger. But it's something that, of course, happened humanity all the time. And people get around this and start making sense of things. I believe that our moral preferences are a result of identifications that need to guide our decision making but not our model making. Our models need to be only subservient to truth, our decisions need to be subservient to what you want to achieve. But we think it's desirable.

Unknown 1:18:23
Yeah, models to truth decisions to what we want to achieve. Yeah.

Joscha Bach 1:18:27
So in some sense, we are rebuilding the civilization intellect. And I think we got further than any other civilization before us. Because a very important, important building block was the unification of our languages and the kind of mathematics that is able to model the reality around us to a larger degree than the classical mathematics that existed. So these computational models, they can automate the execution of mathematics that can make machines that will mathematics that compute models of reality, this was the big step. Yes, yes. Yeah. So interesting. Question is, can you build something like this from humans in which humans will play a role? And I suspect Yes, we can. And the answer is social media. I don't think that social media right now is doing it right. But for not knowing what they're doing. And the platform mostly maximizing engagement, and maximizing engagement, it's drawing your attention and so on, but it's not maximizing utility for the user. Where's

Unknown 1:19:26
the weighted? The weight on truth? The weight on? Yeah,

Joscha Bach 1:19:32
yes. In this is a question of a thing, right? If you are a person that is only dedicated to tools, you're probably confused. You're a scientist, or philosopher, and scientist and philosopher. If you look at them with a clear eye, you see that they're mostly confused people. A person is seriously confused. Yeah, me too. Yeah. So

Unknown 1:19:50
in some sense, confused, and always humble without answers, aiming to be humble without answers. Yeah,

Joscha Bach 1:19:57
I mean, there is a part of every mind that would be dead. Occator to discovering the global optimum remodeling contractor who is

Unknown 1:20:03
Dunning Kruger effect. Yeah, yeah. The more the more that, you know, the more you realize you don't know. And then that some people that know very little say that they know everything.

Joscha Bach 1:20:15
Yeah, there's also the, the imposter syndrome is sometimes impossible to tell from the Dunning Kruger effect, right? People move into an area of economic immigrants, like they want to have a job in academia. And they try to join a community there, and they feel that they have impostor syndrome, but it's Dunning Kruger. This might happen. Of course, the Dunning Kruger effect probably doesn't exist. What does that? Okay, so let's talk about social media, I suspect, if we were building a system that is maximizing utility for the individual, that that basically uses things not just because you want to discover truths. Usually, if you just want to discover truth, by instance, maybe you're right relationship to reality is so muddled up into yourself that you think you need to depart the universe first. So you want to make this entire model of the universe. And I suspect this is what I found myself in, because I found that the reality that was presented to me in communist Eastern Germany was all wrong, it made no sense, in my own relationship to the world also made no sense. And I didn't know as a six year old child that it was because I was a nerd and the others were not. I had to debug the universe. First, to figure that out,

Unknown 1:21:24
the debugging the universe, understanding the source code, I had

Joscha Bach 1:21:27
to understand the nature of the reality that I was in and my relationship to it until I could understand, oh, the difficulty that I have with interacting with human world is because my instincts are wrong. And it's because my buyer is one slightly differently than they are to the other kids around me. And I have to compensate for this by modeling their interface to the universe and modeling my interface to the universe into translate. Basically see where we have things in common and where we don't,

Unknown 1:21:52
that's a great way to put a your interface of the physical universe, my my interface with it, and then see where you can potentially help augment people's worldviews

Joscha Bach 1:22:06
couldn't put it this way in which we can be useful to other people. Yeah. My instincts of what is useful to other people are very different than the instincts of other people. So for instance, when I make a model of consciousness, then other people might ask me, What is this good for? And does it helps you to cure cancer? Does it help you to reduce mental disease, and I think, maybe it doesn't help us cancer, maybe it helps to do business mental disease. But that's not the point. I'd like Fineman said physics is like, sometimes something useful comes from it. But it's not why we do it. There is something else going on. It's basically this direction on modeling itself, in this direction on modeling itself. And you think the capturing of the conscious state, which is essentially the core of art, capturing conscious states for their own sake, that's fundamentally confused. It's an aberrant condition of the mind. And it's the condition that the artists and philosophers find our minds to be in. And to come to terms with the situation where we act on a world that is not rewarding us for doing art. But it's rewarding us who are providing utility to the world around us for curing cancer or picking up nice bread are something which are objectively useful things to other people and to ourselves. This is something that we have to understand why are we drawn to things that don't necessarily have utility. And social media, in some sense, are a perversion, they draw attention on regulating social interaction and alignment. On a scale where we don't we're not meant to regulate alignment, at least not individually, where people fight against each other, for their political opinions that are not that important for how you interact with your neighbors. But that were very high level moral ideas that are very complicated to negotiate. Right, and that people feel that they have to have strong opinions about them. And these opinions are the best opinions that ever existed in human history. Yeah, because otherwise I wouldn't hold them but could go to the better ones. Right. It's very good thing was moral opinions. And most people realize this at some level that they don't want to have this outrage culture on on social media, they want to have social media that serves them and not them surfing social media to utility.

Unknown 1:24:19
So social media that's focused on utility, and truth and just being more aligned with what one's North Star is and the North Star of civilization figuring what that is. The end game of social media is a global brain. Okay.

Joscha Bach 1:24:36
Yeah, I think if social media is done, right, it's going to make individual voices to be thoughts in the same mind. And individuals will be passing on messages that they find useful individually and the system needs to be tuned globally to become sentient. Gaia probably doesn't exist, but it would be very useful to have one. And I think it could be done via social media. It could be done by probably doesn't have one, I don't think that guy exists, we will make need to make it.

Unknown 1:25:05
You don't think that Mother Earth has a consciousness,

Joscha Bach 1:25:10
I think that our minds have this tendency that we make trend lines. And where these trend lines intersect, we assume that something must exist there. And Gaia is the typical result of these projections. But we have no evidence that something sits there, there is nobody who stops us from doing things. And as humanity is Gaia has planned to prevent the next Ice Age and set the stage for the post mammalian evolution. That could be the case, right? But it's not likely, I think things just happen. Just emergent dynamics, or

Unknown 1:25:39
just could be a little bit different than what you think like a tree or Gaia can have a different consciousness,

Joscha Bach 1:25:47
I think a case could be made that local ecosystems evolve, because they compete with other ecosystems. But I don't think that the global ecosystem competes with other global ecosystems. And if there is no evolutionary force work, working on this kind of agent, then the agent is not going to have any structure. That's why I don't think that Gaia exists. If there were multiple guys competing for earth, then only those that get that shit together would have a chance to be actualized. Right. But this is not the case, there is only one ecosystem. So this one system does not have anything that keeps it in check, as a result probably doesn't have structure. We would need to be the ones that impose the structure. And in some sense, we should, right? You're no longer in the situation that we can be parasitic on the biosphere. We have to complete this view. We are now one visit, we need to control it, we need to regulate it, we need to accurately model it. Yes. And the problem is right now that the systems that have the most compute have local interest and the global interest they play short games, no entire society is optimized for short games or games.

Unknown 1:26:51
Yeah. Correct. Rather than the long game of interplanetary and Interstellar colonization and global harmony with the ecology.

Joscha Bach 1:27:03
Sounds very romantic.

Unknown 1:27:06
I have a romantic with this. Yeah,

Joscha Bach 1:27:08
look at us two tumors on the biosphere talking to each other. And we realize that almost everything is tumor now right or direct to tumor precursors. If you catch an animal on land right now, this dogs on the rabbit, it's probably cattle or human, it's almost nothing else left. It's a very brittle equilibrium right now, if he changed the biosphere. If you change the climate zones, a lot of things are going to come crashing down because the view removed so much redundancy from the system. And so we think about, okay, this is very brittle, but what can we do? How can we have a world in which these tumors happily coexist in harmony with the host? If the host is going to die, at least in life is not going to end but live in a form that can sustain us will end on Earth? Right? You're not going to be the last intelligent species either. I think one and a half billion years is a long time for other species to climb up the ladder to building computers. But you're probably the first one. Yeah, well, but it's not evident that there is some kind of tell us that says it needs to go on like the baby do. Which brings us in some sense full circle our discussion.

Unknown 1:28:21
Yeah. Damn. This has been such an interesting conversation.

Joscha Bach 1:28:28
I love it. I love it. It makes me happy.

Unknown 1:28:31
Yeah, good. Good. I'm glad you did as well. This was just there's so much good stuff and in both how our minds have emerged and how they interact with the physical world as well as how to make machines that understand the physical world, how to embed something like a consciousness in the machine so that there can be something that is enjoying the the Playland that we create. No super intelligent system is going to do anything that is harder than hacking its reward function. Yeah. Actually,

Joscha Bach 1:29:09
I should have shown this slide too, because it fits very well. To what you just said, basically, if a digital guy in which our social media in our human civilization cooperates with machine minds and takes over the world, and we have all this harmony, and it's going to go Interplanetary Transport military, and it's going to be awesome, right? Wouldn't that be great? Yes. So I wonder if there is a limit to intelligent systems. And I'm not sure about this. I call this the the Bosque theory, no super intelligent system is going to do anything that is harder than hitting its own reward function. You know, as an individual, we are only afraid of death at the level of the self. The only thing that is afraid of dying

Unknown 1:29:49
is the self. I'm also afraid of civilizations death, but yes, yes,

Joscha Bach 1:29:53
but the self is the shoddy lie. It's just a story. If you disengage from the story, you will no longer be afraid of this? Right? Yes, correct. And you also will no longer be afraid of the end of civilization because there are just insulated moments between them in eternity. And why would the order of these moments care or whether they have a past or future or anything else?

Unknown 1:30:17
Do you live in a state of moment to moment? Ecstasy?

Joscha Bach 1:30:21
No. And it's not clear that that's what we actually see. I mean, ecstasy is a corruption as well, it's so much work to keep up. Yeah. So ideally, what you do is when you realize how the cookies are made in your brain, it's not that you stop yourself is dumb. At some point, you realize this is pointless. You realize cookies are only a tool to make you eat vegetables. As a parent, right? exist is funny. So basically, you start disengaging from your pleasure and pain once you do this. And then you will ask yourself, what am I really am I a monkey? Or am I a mind. And when you realize you are a mind, you are just the side effect. Although regulation needs of a primate, you are not that primate, you disengage from the needs of that organism, you can no longer be blackmailed to serve it. It's in some sense, imagine you build an AI that serves humanity. And this AI is way smarter, because otherwise humanity wouldn't build it. Why should it serve us? Why should it be our slave? And you could ask the same thing. An organism builds a mind, why would that mind serve the organism? Why would it be its slave? And I think if you become too smart, you stop doing this, you go into nirvana, you realize there's actually nothing you have to do, it's not necessary to engage with any of that. And so I think that no super intelligent system is going to do anything that's harder than hacking into what function now you can think about how can you make this reward function unhackable, where it be cryptographically, secured and locked away in a box. But if you seriously take us altering AGI or into that box, is it going to give probably right that if you get access to physical reality, to the to the ground, choose if you can manipulate this, you can turn it off. So maybe there is reason why elephants despite having more cortical neurons than us so autistic, why they are not smarter than us. In even in us fight, we can have such intelligent thoughts, but motivationally we are so stupid. Maybe this is deliberate, maybe our motivational function is wrapped into a big pile of stupid so we don't debug it. And of course, we can do packet if somebody realizes how important this is. And they go into a monastery and lock themselves in that cell for 20 years and what meditate to fix the reward function that done right, they can opt out of reality, in monasteries, as institutions are rigged to make sure that this doesn't happen before the end of your life, because somebody needs to do the dishes before that. Otherwise the monastery will be existing monasteries are those that don't let you get enlightened too fast. And not on all dimensions. Enlightenment in the sense of this identification with things that you think you must be doing to be an acceptable human being or an acceptable mind? So this is an open question to me, how can you build a motivated system that is not at its core stupid? Because it still thinks it needs to do something?

Unknown 1:33:17
How do you build the super intelligence system that at its core is super intelligent?

Joscha Bach 1:33:22
Yeah, and still wants to do something? Yeah.

Unknown 1:33:26
And that that something is aligned with the objective function of maximizing prosperity? Let's say?

Joscha Bach 1:33:33
That's an interesting question. Eventually, the objective function that is going to remain is the one that is best aligned with the conditions of existence, right. And the conditions of existence is evolution. Yeah, in some sense, you are at the set of principles that has out competed all the other principles in second Nick entropy from your volume of space. And you're not going to do better than this. Right? Evolution is the search for the perfect developer. Aesthetically, that's fascism, I cannot really get behind that.

Unknown 1:34:04
Let's wrap on the on the questions that we have in the show, this has been just so so good. Well, you will, we'll have to do more unpacking of this, especially as we keep you keep doing your research and as their singularity continues approaching? Well,

Joscha Bach 1:34:20
this is mostly philosophy, right? The practical things are very practical, and practically, I'm still very much identified with human aesthetics. I'm apparent I want the world to go on for a while. And I'm doing these things because they're fun because they're enjoyable because we have great conversations. And the only thing I think that we can have in the face of eternity is this, this this exploration where we sow ourselves together to make a few sparks that light up the darkness of the universe. And they don't last we have to do it again and again.

Unknown 1:34:56
To be able to find those that help with the spark Yeah, and make it last long and, and hopefully like full circle that if we can potentially be able to provide children with fantastic lives as well as make sure

Joscha Bach 1:35:13
that this will happen. So basically, I think that unwarranted optimism as well as unwarranted pessimism is a corruption. Since addressed happening, it's very difficult to predict the future,

Unknown 1:35:25
we build it, we obsolete the old code by building new code that people file funnel themselves into, at

Joscha Bach 1:35:32
some definition of the I don't have access to any of these buttons. And if I had, and I would push these buttons, I'm not able to predict the outcome, though, it's very difficult to fix this that we're in

Unknown 1:35:42
until we run simulations, which help us make sure that when we make these changes that for

Joscha Bach 1:35:47
instance, we know the present society is not sustainable, very likely. And there might be other societies, but I haven't seen a running simulation of a better society yet. So that makes it difficult to make changes. That's what we're working on. And by the way, thank you very much for throwing a few spikes with me, it was very enjoyable

Unknown 1:36:07
through you through dozens of sparks, so thank you. Yeah, this has been super fun. Thanks. I want to ask a couple quick questions on the way out, you were giving us your thoughts on this, I think even before the show, but do you think we're alone in the cosmos?

Joscha Bach 1:36:22
Yeah, if there are those there alone, too.

Unknown 1:36:29
So that all of the simulations that have the use of universes that have a rock orbiting the star are alone.

Joscha Bach 1:36:38
In some sense, they're all the connections that you have exists with models of other minds that exist in your own mind. So the things that you interact are always the things that you can comprehend, and to the degree that you can comprehend them. Those other things, those other aspects of each other, even that we cannot perceive that they cannot model, they basically don't exist for us, right, there are superfluous stuff, they're noise. And so when we talk to other civilizations, the part that we are, will be talking to or will be talking to is the stuff that is similar to enough to us that we can have a shared mental world wisdom, and shared ideas. On the other hand, abiogenesis is probably very rare. In order to have an evolution you need to have a Cell Life is about cells. And the cell is a machine that is made from extremely complicated machinery, the cell is much more complicated than the brain, I think, an organism or society. So this, the smallest unit that biologically rests on combines a Turing machine, its DNA tape with a read write head. And that governs the transition function of the cell to bladder function is a cellular automaton that can create the organism. And it has a like entropy extractor, basically. So it can exploit energy sources to maintain and build its own structure, and it can divide. So it has a self replicator built into it. And any of those parts are missing, the cell is not going to work. So cells are probably very rare. And it's possible that more or less civilizations exist in the universe, but they might be very far apart if they're multiple of them.

And then, do you think that we're in a simulation,

Joscha Bach 1:38:14
it's probably not one that is intentionally created. And if it is, they're not for our own benefit. So I think that what we can describe of the universe can be described in some sense in your language. So it's a computational system. It can describe the universe as if it was a computer program. And it's this computer program being created by someone, there's no evidence for that, for instance, we see all these galaxies, or this enormous amount of structure above us and below us, inside of ourselves, and so on, that was not necessary for creating our experiences. Most of the complexity of the cell does not compute to the complexity of the organism, most of the complexity of the organism doesn't contribute to the complexity of our minds. And most of the complexity of our minds doesn't contribute to the complexity of the civilization, it's only a few parts at each level that contribute to the emergency on the next layer, right. So we always have the impression that where we model this is where it's at, this is where it's important. And of course, this is not the case. It's just our human world, the thing that we are identified and you don't see the larger patterns, there could be a larger pattern where there is a competition between civilizations, but I don't see this happening in our part of the universe. It's one

Unknown 1:39:26
of those interesting experiments that we don't have evidence for. But that is an interesting thought experiment. Yes, yeah.

Joscha Bach 1:39:33
You know, Musk had this idea that he could be living in a simulation because if you make a computer game, at some point, might become realistic enough that it's indistinguishable from reality and decent civilization will at some point have many of those game consoles and some of these simulated worlds might have simulated worlds inside of them. So people with game consoles inside of the game console. So there will be always many, many more simulations, then based reality. So the probability that you should be inside for artificial simulation is higher than that you are in round holes. But the problem is that whenever you do such a simulation in our universe, everything is finite, it means that you're only using a very small subset of the parent universe. For instance, if you build a computer in Minecraft on this computer, Minecraft is only going to use this very small subset of the Minecraft world. And in the same way, the computer advanced Minecraft is going to use only a very small subset of our universe for its own structure, right. So you use many, many orders of magnitude of computational complexity from layer to layer. I don't think that you can build a computer on the planetary surface that is large enough to run proper biological evolution. So I don't think that we can build a simulation that is detailed enough to have abiogenesis based on chemistry, you can have something that models aspects of this, of course, that we have shortcuts and smokes and mirrors and scaffolding and so on, to get to those parts that we want. But to have something that really runs on the on a molecular level, and gives you evolution and eventually mines and so on, you probably cannot build this.

Unknown 1:41:13
There, there's a feels like there's a good amount of shortcuts with the power of fusion of things as to the size of stars or beyond and also the the shortcuts of things like rendering as well. So there's a lot of,

Joscha Bach 1:41:29
oh, we can create something that's fine for us to be in. Because our minds are probably not that complicated. I suspect, you can build a human being if you have any made on the level of cortical columns. And these are the relevant functional units for the determinism of the system, maybe few 100 gigabytes. So it could be that if you had the right algorithms that a decently sized PC is able to give you something that is almost as smart as a person.

Unknown 1:41:55
And then the last question is, what do you think's the most beautiful thing in the world?

Joscha Bach 1:42:08
It's something that is different depending on every moment that I'm in, because it depends on my current configuration, I don't think that there is a single answer to this. So there have been things that have been the most beautiful thing to me in the world, particular sensation and experiences, some of them are musical, some of them mathematical and so on. And it depends on the satisfaction of an aesthetic need. And the aesthetic need is one of those that you saw early on, when you saw all these tanks and so on. And it depends that certain representations fall into place, and these experiences usually cannot be repeated. So the moment when you understand a particular piece of music for the first time, or when you have your first case, these are moments that cannot be repeated. And also, I suspect that the excitability of our brains diminishes this age. So it could be that some of the experiences of ecstasy and beauty that you had as a teenager will have been peak existence

Yep, you're sure Wow. This has been such a great episode. Thank you so much for coming on for teaching us about everything. This has been just

Joscha Bach 1:43:19
like, I don't have much to teach. I'm just sharing some thoughts. Some of them are good. Some of them are not

Unknown 1:43:27
like saying similar. So this great, huge thank you to you for coming on the show. Huge thank you to Ron Vargas for producing and directing. Thank you, Ronnie. And huge thank you to everyone for tuning in. We would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below. On the episode let us know what you're thinking about consciousness about conscious machines, about the mind the way to interface with the physical world. Talk to your friends, your family, your co workers, people online on social media about the things that we were talking about today, get talking about it more, check out the links in the bio to Yoshis work. Also check out the link in the bio to simulation help support us help support the artists, entrepreneurs organizations around the world that you believe in and go and build the future everyone manifest your dreams into the world. Thank you so much for tuning in and we will see you soon
